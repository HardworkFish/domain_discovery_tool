Run Crawler
-----------

Once a sufficiently good model is available you can start the ACHE crawler by clicking on "Start Crawler" button at the top shown in figure below. This starts the crawler with the model built with the relevant and irrelevant annotations. 

You can see the results of the crawled data in "Crawled Data" in the Filters Tab. When the crawler is running it can be monitored at http://<hostname>:8080/.
