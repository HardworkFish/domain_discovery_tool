RadViz is a visualization scheme that enables users to explore and analyze data sets (pages) in terms of similarity relations among semantic descriptors (keywords on the pages).

This kind of analysis allows users to identify regions of interest in the data set (pages) according to the most relevant terms (keywords) on the pages.

Pages can be tagged through RadViz as ’Positive’ and ’Negative’ by drawing lasso around any region of interest, which made the selection of a sub-group of pages very easy, and then users can tag the selected pages as ’Positive’ and ’Negative’. To create the lasso the user simply drags a freehand selection around the pages located into the circle in RadViz, in a similar way to how you would outline something on a piece of paper with a pen or pencil. To start the lasso users simply have to click at the spot where you want to begin the selection, then continue holding your mouse button down and drag to draw a freeform selection outline.
To complete the selection, simply return to the spot where you began and release your mouse button. You don't necessarily have to return the same spot you started from, but if you don't, RadViz will automatically close the selection for you by drawing a straight line from the point where you released your mouse button to the point where you began, so in most cases, you will want to finish where you started.
