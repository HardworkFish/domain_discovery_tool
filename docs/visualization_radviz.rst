RadViz is a visualization scheme that enables users to explore and analyze data sets (pages which are represented as points in the visualization) in terms of similarity relations among semantic descriptors (keywords on the pages). Keywords are located along a circle, and pages are represented as a points into the circle. Where a higher similarity means a closer distance between pages. Also, the greater the proximity of a page to a keyword, the greater the frequency of occurrence of that keyword in this page. This kind of analysis allows users to identify regions of interest in the data set (pages) according to the most relevant terms (keywords) on the pages.
Pages can be tagged through RadViz as ’Positive’ and ’Negative’, and even Custom Tag, by drawing lasso around any region of interest, which made the selection of a sub-group of pages very easy, and then users can tag the selected pages as ’Positive’, ’Negative’ and Custom Tag.
