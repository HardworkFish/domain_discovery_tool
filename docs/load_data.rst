Load Data
---------

Expand the Search tab on the left panel. You can add data to the domain in the following ways:

Web Search
~~~~~~~~~~

   :align: center
   :height: 400px
   :alt: alternate text

You can do a keywords search on google or bing by clicking on the **WEB** tab. For example, “ebola symptoms”. 

Upload URLs
~~~~~~~~~~~

Go to the **LOAD** tab. You can upload a list of urls in the text box as shown in figure below:

.. image:: load_url_text.png
   :width: 800px
   :align: center
   :height: 400px
   :alt: alternate text

Enter one URL per line.

You can also upload a file with a list of urls by clicking on the **LOAD URLS FROM FILE** button. This will bring up a file explorer window where you can select the file to upload. The list of URLs should be entered one per line in the file. Download an example URLs list file for ebola domain `HERE <https://github.com/ViDA-NYU/domain_discovery_tool_react/raw/master/docs/ebola_urls.txt>`_. 

SeedFinder
~~~~~~~~~~

Instead of making multiple queries to Google/Bing yourself you can trigger automated keyword search on Google/Bing and collects seed urls using the SeedFinder. This requires a domain model.
