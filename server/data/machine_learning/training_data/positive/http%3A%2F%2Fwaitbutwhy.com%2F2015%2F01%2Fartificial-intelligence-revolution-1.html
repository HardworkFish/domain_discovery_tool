<p class="p1" style="text-align: left;"><em><strong>Note:</strong> The reason this post took three weeks to finish is that as I dug into research on Artificial Intelligence, I could not <strong>believe</strong> what I was reading. It hit me pretty quickly that what&#8217;s happening in the world of AI is not just an important topic, but by far THE most important topic for our future. So I wanted to learn as much as I could about it, and once I did that, I wanted to make sure I wrote a post that really explained this whole situation and why it matters so much. Not shockingly, that became outrageously long, so I broke it into two parts. This is Part 1—Part 2 is <a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2015/01/artificial-intelligence-revolution-2.html">here</a>. </em></p>

<p>It seems like a pretty intense place to be standing—but then you have to remember something about what it’s like to stand on a time graph: you can’t see what’s to your right. So here’s how it actually feels to stand there:</p>
<p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3246" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge.jpg" alt="Edge" width="500" height="356" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge.jpg 1265w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge-300x213.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Edge-600x427.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 500px) 100vw, 500px" /></a></p>
<p>Which probably feels pretty normal…</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">_______________</p>
<h2 style="text-align: center;"><strong>The Far Future—Coming Soon</strong></h2>
<p>Imagine taking a time machine back to 1750—a time when the world was in a permanent power outage, long-distance communication meant either yelling loudly or firing a cannon in the air, and all transportation ran on hay. When you get there, you retrieve a dude, bring him to 2015, and then walk him around and watch him react to everything. It&#8217;s impossible for us to understand what it would be like for him to see shiny capsules racing by on a highway, talk to people who had been on the other side of the ocean earlier in the day, watch sports that were being played 1,000 miles away, hear a musical performance that happened 50 years ago, and play with my magical wizard rectangle that he could use to capture a real-life image or record a living moment, generate a map with a paranormal moving blue dot that shows him where he is, look at someone&#8217;s face and chat with them even though they&#8217;re on the other side of the country, and worlds of other inconceivable sorcery. This is all before you show him the internet or explain things like the International Space Station, the Large Hadron Collider, nuclear weapons, or general relativity.</p>
<p>This experience for him wouldn&#8217;t be surprising or shocking or even mind-blowing—those words aren&#8217;t big enough. He might actually die.</p>
<p>But here&#8217;s the interesting thing—if he then went back to 1750 and got jealous that we got to see his reaction and decided he wanted to try the same thing, he&#8217;d take the time machine and go back the same distance, get someone from around the year 1500, bring him to 1750, and show him everything. And the 1500 guy would be shocked by a lot of things—but he wouldn&#8217;t die. It would be <em>far </em>less of an insane experience for him, because while 1500 and 1750 were very different, they were <em>much </em><em>less </em>different than 1750 to 2015. The 1500 guy would learn some mind-bending shit about space and physics, he&#8217;d be impressed with how committed Europe turned out to be with that new imperialism fad, and he&#8217;d have to do some major revisions of his world map conception. But watching everyday life go by in 1750—transportation, communication, etc.—definitely wouldn&#8217;t make him die.</p>
<p>No, in order for the 1750 guy to have as much fun as we had with him, he&#8217;d have to go much farther back—maybe all the way back to about 12,000 BC, before the First Agricultural Revolution gave rise to the first cities and to the concept of civilization. If someone from a purely hunter-gatherer world—from a time when humans were, more or less, just another animal species—saw the vast human empires of 1750 with their towering churches, their ocean-crossing ships, their concept of being &#8220;inside,&#8221; and their enormous mountain of collective, accumulated human knowledge and discovery—he&#8217;d likely die.</p>
<p>And then what if, after dying, <em>he </em>got jealous and wanted to do the same thing. If he went back 12,000 years to 24,000 BC and got a guy and brought him to 12,000 BC, he&#8217;d show the guy everything and the guy would be like, &#8220;Okay what&#8217;s your point who cares.&#8221; For the 12,000 BC guy to have the same fun, he&#8217;d have to go back over 100,000 years and get someone he could show fire and language to for the first time.</p>
<p>In order for someone to be transported into the future and die from the level of shock they&#8217;d experience, they have to go enough years ahead that a &#8220;die level of progress,&#8221; or a Die Progress Unit (DPU) has been achieved. So a DPU took over 100,000 years in hunter-gatherer times, but at the post-Agricultural Revolution rate, it only took about 12,000 years. The post-Industrial Revolution world has moved so quickly that a 1750 person only needs to go forward a couple hundred years for a DPU to have happened.</p>
<p>This pattern—human progress moving quicker and quicker as time goes on—is what futurist Ray Kurzweil calls human history&#8217;s Law of Accelerating Returns. This happens because more advanced societies have the ability to progress at a faster <em>rate</em> than less advanced societies—<em>because</em> they&#8217;re more advanced. 19th century humanity knew more and had better technology than 15th century humanity, so it&#8217;s no surprise that humanity made far more advances in the 19th century than in the 15th century—15th century humanity was no match for 19th century humanity.<a href="#footnote-1-3216" id="note-1-3216" rel="footnote">1</a><a href="#footnote2-1-3216" id="note2-1-3216" rel="footnote2">1</a></span><span style="font-size: large;"><sup>← open these</sup></span></p>
<p>This works on smaller scales too. The movie <em>Back to the Future</em> came out in 1985, and &#8220;the past&#8221; took place in 1955. In the movie, when Michael J. Fox went back to 1955, he was caught off-guard by the newness of TVs, the prices of soda, the lack of love for shrill electric guitar, and the variation in slang. It was a different world, yes—but if the movie were made today and the past took place in 1985, the movie could have had <em>much </em>more fun with <em>much </em>bigger differences. The character would be in a time before personal computers, internet, or cell phones—today&#8217;s Marty McFly, a teenager born in the late 90s, would be much more out of place in 1985 than the movie&#8217;s Marty McFly was in 1955.</p>
<p>This is for the same reason we just discussed—the Law of Accelerating Returns. The average rate of advancement between 1985 and 2015 was higher than the rate between 1955 and 1985—because the former was a more advanced world—so much more change happened in the most recent 30 years than in the prior 30.</p>
<p>So—advances are getting bigger and bigger and happening more and more quickly. This suggests some pretty intense things about our future, right?</p>
<p>Kurzweil suggests that the progress of the entire 20th century would have been achieved in only 20 years at the rate of advancement in the year 2000—in other words, by 2000, the rate of progress was five times faster than the <em>average </em>rate of progress during the 20th century. He believes another 20th century&#8217;s worth of progress happened between 2000 and 2014 and that <em>another </em>20th century&#8217;s worth of progress will happen by 2021, in only seven years. A couple decades later, he believes a 20th century&#8217;s worth of progress will happen multiple times in the same year, and even later, in less than one month. All in all, because of the Law of Accelerating Returns, Kurzweil believes that the 21st century will achieve <i>1,000 times </i>the progress of the 20th century.<a href="#footnote2-2-3216" id="note2-2-3216" rel="footnote2">2</a>
<p>If Kurzweil and others who agree with him are correct, then we may be as blown away by 2030 as our 1750 guy was by 2015—i.e. the next DPU might only take a couple decades—and the world in 2050 might be <em>so </em>vastly different than today&#8217;s world that we would barely recognize it.</p>
<p>This isn&#8217;t science fiction. It&#8217;s what many scientists smarter and more knowledgeable than you or I firmly believe—and if you look at history, it&#8217;s what we should logically predict.</p>
<p>So then why, when you hear me say something like &#8220;the world 35 years from now might be totally unrecognizable,&#8221; are you thinking, &#8220;Cool&#8230;.but nahhhhhhh&#8221;? Three reasons we&#8217;re skeptical of outlandish forecasts of the future:</p>
<p><strong>1) When it comes to history, we think in straight lines. </strong>When we imagine the progress of the next 30 years, we look back to the progress of the previous 30 as an indicator of how much will likely happen. When we think about the extent to which the world will change in the 21st century, we just take the 20th century progress and add it to the year 2000. This was the same mistake our 1750 guy made when he got someone from 1500 and expected to blow his mind as much as his own was blown going the same distance ahead. It&#8217;s most intuitive for us to think <em>linearly,</em> when we should be thinking <em>exponentially</em>. If someone is being more clever about it, they might predict the advances of the next 30 years not by looking at the previous 30 years, but by taking the <em>current </em>rate of progress and judging based on that. They&#8217;d be more accurate, but still way off. In order to think about the future correctly, you need to imagine things moving at a <em>much faster rate </em>than they&#8217;re moving now.</p>
<p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3235" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections.png" alt="Projections" width="637" height="392" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections.png 1400w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections-300x184.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Projections-600x369.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 637px) 100vw, 637px" /></a></p>
<p><strong>2) The trajectory of very recent history often tells a distorted story. </strong>First, even a steep exponential curve seems linear when you only look at a tiny slice of it, the same way if you look at a little segment of a huge circle up close, it looks almost like a straight line. Second, exponential growth isn&#8217;t totally smooth and uniform. Kurzweil explains that progress happens in &#8220;S-curves&#8221;:</p>
<p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/S-Curves2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3241" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/S-Curves2.png" alt="S-Curves" width="479" height="391" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/S-Curves2.png 1376w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/S-Curves2-300x245.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/S-Curves2-600x490.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 479px) 100vw, 479px" /></a></p>
<p>An S is created by the wave of progress when a new paradigm sweeps the world. The curve goes through three phases:</p>
<p style="padding-left: 30px;"><span style="color: #808080;">1. Slow growth (the early phase of exponential growth)</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;">2. Rapid growth (the late, explosive phase of exponential growth)</span><br />
<span style="color: #808080;">3. A leveling off as the particular paradigm matures</span><a href="#footnote2-3-3216" id="note2-3-3216" rel="footnote2">3</a>
<p>If you look only at very recent history, the part of the S-curve you&#8217;re on at the moment can obscure your perception of how fast things are advancing. The chunk of time between 1995 and 2007 saw the explosion of the internet, the introduction of Microsoft, Google, and Facebook into the public consciousness, the birth of social networking, and the introduction of cell phones and then smart phones. That was Phase 2: the growth spurt part of the S. But 2008 to 2015 has been less groundbreaking, at least on the technological front. Someone thinking about the future today might examine the last few years to gauge the current rate of advancement, but that&#8217;s missing the bigger picture. In fact, a new, huge Phase 2 growth spurt might be brewing right now.</p>
<p><b>3) </b><strong>Our own experience makes us stubborn old men about the future. </strong>We base our ideas about the world on our personal experience, and that experience has ingrained the rate of growth of the recent past in our heads as &#8220;the way things happen.&#8221; We&#8217;re also limited by our imagination, which takes our experience and uses it to conjure future predictions—but often, what we know simply doesn&#8217;t give us the tools to think accurately about the future.<a href="#footnote-2-3216" id="note-2-3216" rel="footnote">2</a> When we hear a prediction about the future that contradicts our experience-based notion of <em>how things work</em>, our instinct is that the prediction must be naive. If I tell you, later in this post, that you may live to be 150, or 250, or <em>not die at all</em>, your instinct will be, &#8220;That&#8217;s stupid—if there&#8217;s one thing I know from history, it&#8217;s that everybody dies.&#8221; And yes, no one in the past has not died. But no one flew airplanes before airplanes were invented either.</p>
<p>So while <em>nahhhhh </em>might feel right as you read this post, it&#8217;s probably actually wrong. The fact is, if we&#8217;re being truly logical and expecting historical patterns to continue, we should conclude that much, much, <em>much </em>more should change in the coming decades than we intuitively expect. Logic also suggests that if the most advanced species on a planet keeps making larger and larger leaps forward at an ever-faster rate, at some point, they&#8217;ll make a leap so great that it completely alters life as they know it and the perception they have of what it means to be a human—kind of like how evolution kept making great leaps toward intelligence until finally it made such a large leap to the human being that it completely altered what it meant for any creature to live on planet Earth. And if you spend some time reading about what&#8217;s going on today in science and technology, you start to see a lot of signs quietly hinting that life as we currently know it cannot withstand the leap that&#8217;s coming next.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re like me, you used to think Artificial Intelligence was a silly sci-fi concept, but lately you&#8217;ve been hearing it mentioned by serious people, and you don&#8217;t really quite get it.</p>
<p>There are three reasons a lot of people are confused about the term AI:</p>
<p><strong>1)</strong> <strong>We associate AI with movies. </strong>Star Wars. Terminator. 2001: A Space Odyssey. Even the Jetsons. And those are fiction, as are the robot characters. So it makes AI sound a little fictional to us.</p>
<p><strong>2) AI is a broad topic.</strong> It ranges from your phone&#8217;s calculator to self-driving cars to something in the future that might change the world dramatically. AI refers to all of these things, which is confusing.</p>
<p><strong>3) We use AI all the time in our daily lives, but we often don&#8217;t realize it&#8217;s AI.</strong> John McCarthy, who coined the term &#8220;Artificial Intelligence&#8221; in 1956, complained that “as soon as it works, no one calls it AI anymore.”<a href="#footnote2-4-3216" id="note2-4-3216" rel="footnote2">4</a> Because of this phenomenon, AI often sounds like a mythical future prediction more than a reality. At the same time, it makes it sound like a pop concept from the past that never came to fruition. Ray Kurzweil says he hears people say that AI withered in the 1980s, which he compares to &#8220;insisting that the Internet died in the dot-com bust of the early 2000s.&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-5-3216" id="note2-5-3216" rel="footnote2">5</a>
<p>So let&#8217;s clear things up. First, stop thinking of <em>robots</em>. A robot is a <em>container </em>for AI, sometimes mimicking the human form, sometimes not—but the AI itself is the computer <em>inside </em>the robot. AI is the brain, and the robot is its body—if it even has a body. For example, the software and data behind Siri is AI, the woman&#8217;s voice we hear is a personification of that AI, and there&#8217;s no robot involved at all.</p>
<p>Secondly, you&#8217;ve probably heard the term &#8220;singularity&#8221; or &#8220;technological singularity.&#8221; This term has been used in math to describe an asymptote-like situation where normal rules no longer apply. It&#8217;s been used in physics to describe a phenomenon like an infinitely small, dense black hole or the point we were all squished into right before the Big Bang. Again, situations where the usual rules don&#8217;t apply. In 1993, Vernor Vinge wrote a <a href="https://www-rohan.sdsu.edu/faculty/vinge/misc/singularity.html" target="_blank">famous essay</a> in which he applied the term to the moment in the future when our technology&#8217;s intelligence exceeds our own—a moment for him when life as we know it will be forever changed and normal rules will no longer apply. Ray Kurzweil then muddled things a bit by defining the singularity as the time when the Law of Accelerating Returns has reached such an extreme pace that technological progress is happening at a seemingly-infinite pace, and after which we&#8217;ll be living in a whole new world. I found that many of today&#8217;s AI thinkers have stopped using the term, and it&#8217;s confusing anyway, so I won&#8217;t use it much here (even though we&#8217;ll be focusing on that <em>idea</em> throughout).</p>
<p>Finally, while there are many different types or forms of AI since AI is a broad concept, the critical categories we need to think about are based on an AI&#8217;s <em>caliber</em>. There are three major AI caliber categories:</p>
<p><strong>AI Caliber 1) Artificial Narrow Intelligence (ANI): </strong>Sometimes referred to as <em>Weak AI</em>, Artificial Narrow Intelligence is AI that specializes in <em>one</em> area. There&#8217;s AI that can beat the world chess champion in chess, but that&#8217;s the only thing it does. Ask it to figure out a better way to store data on a hard drive, and it&#8217;ll look at you blankly.</p>
<p><strong>AI Caliber 2) Artificial General Intelligence (AGI): </strong>Sometimes referred to as <em>Strong AI</em>, or <em>Human-Level AI</em>, Artificial General Intelligence refers to a computer that is as smart as a human <em>across the board—</em>a machine that can perform any intellectual task that a human being can. Creating AGI is a <em>much </em>harder task than creating ANI, and we&#8217;re yet to do it. Professor Linda Gottfredson describes intelligence as &#8220;a very general mental capability that, among other things, involves the ability to reason, plan, solve problems, think abstractly, comprehend complex ideas, learn quickly, and learn from experience.&#8221; AGI would be able to do all of those things as easily as you can.</p>
<p><strong>AI Caliber 3) Artificial Superintelligence (ASI):</strong> Oxford philosopher and leading AI thinker Nick Bostrom <a href="http://www.nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html" target="_blank">defines</a> superintelligence as &#8220;an intellect that is much smarter than the best human brains in practically every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom and social skills.&#8221; Artificial Superintelligence ranges from a computer that&#8217;s just a little smarter than a human to one that&#8217;s trillions of times smarter—across the board. ASI is the reason the topic of AI is such a spicy meatball and why the words &#8220;immortality&#8221; and &#8220;extinction&#8221; will both appear in these posts multiple times.</p>
<p>As of now, humans have conquered the lowest caliber of AI—ANI—in many ways, and it&#8217;s everywhere. The AI Revolution is the road from ANI, through AGI, to ASI—a road we may or may not survive but that, either way, will change everything.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s take a close look at what the leading thinkers in the field believe this road looks like and why this revolution might happen way sooner than you might think:</p>
<h3>Where We Are Currently—A World Running on ANI</h3>
<p>Artificial Narrow Intelligence is machine intelligence that equals or exceeds human intelligence or efficiency at a <em>specific </em>thing. A few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Cars are full of ANI systems, from the computer that figures out when the anti-lock brakes should kick in to the computer that tunes the parameters of the fuel injection systems. Google&#8217;s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCCLyNDhxwpqNe3UeEmGHl8g" target="_blank">self-driving car</a>, which is being tested now, will contain robust ANI systems that allow it to perceive and react to the world around it.</li>
<li>Your phone is a little ANI factory. When you navigate using your map app, receive tailored music recommendations from Pandora, check tomorrow&#8217;s weather, talk to Siri, or dozens of other everyday activities, you&#8217;re using ANI.</li>
<li>Your email spam filter is a classic type of ANI—it starts off loaded with intelligence about how to figure out what&#8217;s spam and what&#8217;s not, and then it learns and tailors its intelligence to you as it gets experience with your particular preferences. The Nest Thermostat does the same thing as it starts to figure out your typical routine and act accordingly.</li>
<li>You know the whole creepy thing that goes on when you search for a product on Amazon and then you see that as a &#8220;recommended for you&#8221; product on a <em>different </em>site, or when Facebook somehow knows who it makes sense for you to add as a friend? That&#8217;s a network of ANI systems, working together to inform each other about who you are and what you like and then using that information to decide what to show you. Same goes for Amazon&#8217;s &#8220;People who bought this also bought&#8230;&#8221; thing—that&#8217;s an ANI system whose job it is to gather info from the behavior of millions of customers and synthesize that info to cleverly upsell you so you&#8217;ll buy more things.</li>
<li>Google Translate is another classic ANI system—impressively good at one narrow task. Voice recognition is another, and there are a bunch of apps that use those two ANIs as a tag team, allowing you to speak a sentence in one language and have the phone spit out the same sentence in another.</li>
<li>When your plane lands, it&#8217;s not a human that decides which gate it should go to. Just like it&#8217;s not a human that determined the price of your ticket.</li>
<li>The world&#8217;s best Checkers, Chess, Scrabble, Backgammon, and Othello players are now all ANI systems.</li>
<li>Google search is one large ANI brain with incredibly sophisticated methods for ranking pages and figuring out what to show you in particular. Same goes for Facebook&#8217;s Newsfeed.</li>
<li>And those are just in the consumer world. Sophisticated ANI systems are widely used in sectors and industries like military, manufacturing, and finance (algorithmic high-frequency AI traders account for more than half of equity shares traded on US markets<a href="#footnote2-6-3216" id="note2-6-3216" rel="footnote2">6</a>), and in expert systems like those that help doctors make diagnoses and, most famously, IBM&#8217;s <a href="https://www.ibm.com/smarterplanet/us/en/ibmwatson/" target="_blank">Watson</a>, who contained enough facts and understood coy Trebek-speak well enough to soundly beat the most prolific <em>Jeopardy</em> champions.</li>
</ul>
<p>ANI systems as they are now aren&#8217;t especially scary. At worst, a glitchy or badly-programmed ANI can cause an isolated catastrophe like knocking out a power grid, causing a harmful nuclear power plant malfunction, or triggering a financial markets disaster (like the <a href="http://www.ritholtz.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2010/10/flash-crash-dow-popup.png" target="_blank">2010 Flash Crash</a> when an ANI program reacted the wrong way to an unexpected situation and caused the stock market to briefly plummet, taking $1 trillion of market value with it, only part of which was recovered when the mistake was corrected).</p>
<p>But while ANI doesn&#8217;t have the capability to cause an <em>existential threat</em>, we should see this increasingly large and complex ecosystem of relatively-harmless ANI as a precursor of the world-altering hurricane that&#8217;s on the way. Each new ANI innovation quietly adds another brick onto the road to AGI and ASI. Or as Aaron Saenz <a href="http://singularityhub.com/2010/08/10/we-live-in-a-jungle-of-artificial-intelligence-that-will-spawn-sentience/" target="_blank">sees it</a>, our world&#8217;s ANI systems &#8220;are like the amino acids in the early Earth&#8217;s primordial ooze&#8221;—the inanimate stuff of life that, one unexpected day, woke up.</p>
<h3><strong>The Road From ANI to AGI</strong></h3>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;">Why It&#8217;s So Hard</span></p>
<p>Nothing will make you appreciate human intelligence like learning about how unbelievably challenging it is to try to create a computer as smart as we are. Building skyscrapers, putting humans in space, figuring out the details of how the Big Bang went down—all far easier than understanding our own brain or how to make something as cool as it. As of now, the human brain is the most complex object in the known universe.</p>
<p>What&#8217;s interesting is that the hard parts of trying to build AGI (a computer as smart as humans in <em>general</em>, not just at one narrow specialty) are not intuitively what you&#8217;d think they are. Build a computer that can multiply two ten-digit numbers in a split second—incredibly easy. Build one that can look at a dog and answer whether it&#8217;s a dog or a cat—spectacularly difficult. Make AI that can beat any human in chess? Done. Make one that can read a paragraph from a six-year-old&#8217;s picture book and not just recognize the words but understand the <em>meaning</em> of them? Google is currently spending <a href="https://www.wired.com/2014/01/google-buying-way-making-brain-irrelevant/" target="_blank">billions</a> of dollars trying to do it. Hard things—like calculus, financial market strategy, and language translation—are mind-numbingly easy for a computer, while easy things—like vision, motion, movement, and perception—are insanely hard for it. Or, as computer scientist Donald Knuth puts it, “AI has by now succeeded in doing essentially everything that requires ‘thinking’ but has failed to do most of what people and animals do ‘without thinking.'&#8221;<a href="#footnote2-7-3216" id="note2-7-3216" rel="footnote2">7</a>
<p>What you quickly realize when you think about this is that those things that seem easy to us are actually unbelievably complicated, and they only seem easy because those skills have been optimized in us (and most animals) by hundreds of millions of years of animal evolution. When you reach your hand up toward an object, the muscles, tendons, and bones in your shoulder, elbow, and wrist instantly perform a long series of physics operations, in conjunction with your eyes, to allow you to move your hand in a straight line through three dimensions. It seems effortless to you because you have perfected software in your brain for doing it. Same idea goes for why it&#8217;s not that malware is dumb for not being able to figure out the slanty word recognition test when you sign up for a new account on a site—it&#8217;s that your brain is super impressive for being <em>able </em>to.</p>
<p>On the other hand, multiplying big numbers or playing chess are new activities for biological creatures and we haven&#8217;t had any time to evolve a proficiency at them, so a computer doesn&#8217;t need to work too hard to beat us. Think about it—which would you rather do, build a program that could multiply big numbers or one that could understand the essence of a B well enough that you could show it a B in any one of thousands of unpredictable fonts or handwriting and it could instantly know it was a B?</p>
<p>One fun example—when you look at this, you and a computer both can figure out that it&#8217;s a rectangle with two distinct shades, alternating:</p>

<p>&#8230;you have no problem giving a full description of the various opaque and translucent cylinders, slats, and 3-D corners, but the computer would fail miserably. It would describe what it sees—a variety of two-dimensional shapes in several different shades—which is actually what&#8217;s there. Your brain is doing a ton of fancy shit to interpret the implied depth, shade-mixing, and room lighting the picture is trying to portray.<a href="#footnote2-8-3216" id="note2-8-3216" rel="footnote2">8</a> And looking at the picture below, a computer sees a two-dimensional white, black, and gray collage, while you easily see what it really is—a photo of an entirely-black, 3-D rock:</p>

<p>And everything we just mentioned is still only taking in stagnant information and processing it. To be human-level intelligent, a computer would have to understand things like the difference between subtle facial expressions, the distinction between being pleased, relieved, content, satisfied, and glad, and why <em>Braveheart </em>was great but <em>The Patriot</em> was terrible.</p>
<p>Daunting.</p>
<p>So how do we get there?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;">First Key to Creating AGI: Increasing Computational Power</span></p>
<p>One thing that definitely needs to happen for AGI to be a possibility is an increase in the power of computer hardware. If an AI system is going to be as intelligent as the brain, it&#8217;ll need to equal the brain&#8217;s raw computing capacity.</p>
<p>One way to express this capacity is in the total calculations per second (cps) the brain could manage, and you could come to this number by figuring out the maximum cps of each structure in the brain and then adding them all together.</p>
<p>Ray Kurzweil came up with a shortcut by taking someone&#8217;s professional estimate for the cps of one structure and that structure&#8217;s weight compared to that of the whole brain and then multiplying proportionally to get an estimate for the total. Sounds a little iffy, but he did this a bunch of times with various professional estimates of different regions, and the total always arrived in the same ballpark—around 10<sup>16</sup>, or 10 quadrillion cps.</p>
<p>Currently, the world&#8217;s fastest supercomputer, China&#8217;s <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/17/us-china-supercomputer-idUSKCN0J11VV20141117" target="_blank">Tianhe-2</a>, has actually beaten that number, clocking in at about 34 quadrillion cps. But Tianhe-2 is also a dick, taking up 720 square meters of space, using 24 megawatts of power (the brain runs on just <a href="http://www.popsci.com/technology/article/2009-11/neuron-computer-chips-could-overcome-power-limitations-digital" target="_blank">20 watts</a>), and costing $390 million to build. Not especially applicable to wide usage, or even most commercial or industrial usage yet.</p>
<p>Kurzweil suggests that we think about the state of computers by looking at how many cps you can buy for $1,000. When that number reaches human-level—10 quadrillion cps—then that&#8217;ll mean AGI could become a very real part of life.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law" target="_blank">Moore&#8217;s Law</a> is a historically-reliable rule that the world&#8217;s maximum computing power doubles approximately every two years, meaning computer hardware advancement, like general human advancement through history, grows exponentially. Looking at how this relates to Kurzweil&#8217;s cps/$1,000 metric, we&#8217;re currently at about 10 trillion cps/$1,000, right on pace with this graph&#8217;s predicted trajectory:<a href="#footnote2-9-3216" id="note2-9-3216" rel="footnote2">9</a>
<p><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3229" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1.jpg" alt="PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1" width="600" height="512" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1.jpg 1020w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1-300x256.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/PPTExponentialGrowthof_Computing-1-600x512.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" /></a></p>
<p>So the world&#8217;s $1,000 computers are now beating the mouse brain and they&#8217;re at about a thousandth of human level. This doesn&#8217;t sound like much until you remember that we were at about a trillionth of human level in 1985, a billionth in 1995, and a millionth in 2005. Being at a thousandth in 2015 puts us right on pace to get to an affordable computer by 2025 that rivals the power of the brain.</p>
<p>So on the hardware side, the raw power needed for AGI is technically available now, in China, and we&#8217;ll be ready for affordable, widespread AGI-caliber hardware within 10 years. But raw computational power alone doesn&#8217;t make a computer generally intelligent—the next question is, how do we bring human-level intelligence to all that power?</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 16pt;">Second Key to Creating AGI: Making It Smart</span></p>
<p>This is the icky part. The truth is, no one really knows how to make it smart—we&#8217;re still debating how to make a computer human-level intelligent and capable of knowing what a dog and a weird-written B and a mediocre movie is. But there are a bunch of far-fetched strategies out there and at some point, one of them will work. Here are the three most common strategies I came across:</p>
<h4><strong>1) Plagiarize the brain. </strong></h4>
<p>This is like scientists toiling over how that kid who sits next to them in class is so smart and keeps doing so well on the tests, and even though they keep studying diligently, they can&#8217;t do nearly as well as that kid, and then they finally decide &#8220;k fuck it I&#8217;m just gonna copy that kid&#8217;s answers.&#8221; It makes sense—we&#8217;re stumped trying to build a super-complex computer, and there happens to be a perfect prototype for one in each of our heads.</p>
<p>The science world is working hard on reverse engineering the brain to figure out how evolution made such a rad thing—<a href="https://www.wired.com/2010/08/reverse-engineering-brain-kurzweil/" target="_blank">optimistic estimates</a> say we can do this by 2030. Once we do that, we&#8217;ll know all the secrets of how the brain runs so powerfully and efficiently and we can draw inspiration from it and steal its innovations. One example of computer architecture that mimics the brain is the artificial neural network. It starts out as a network of transistor &#8220;neurons,&#8221; connected to each other with inputs and outputs, and it knows nothing—like an infant brain. The way it &#8220;learns&#8221; is it tries to do a task, say handwriting recognition, and at first, its neural firings and subsequent guesses at deciphering each letter will be completely random. But when it&#8217;s told it got something right, the transistor connections in the firing pathways that happened to create that answer are strengthened; when it&#8217;s told it was wrong, those pathways&#8217; connections are weakened. After a lot of this trial and feedback, the network has, by itself, formed smart neural pathways and the machine has become optimized for the task. The brain learns a bit like this but in a more sophisticated way, and as we continue to study the brain, we&#8217;re discovering ingenious new ways to take advantage of neural circuitry.</p>
<p>More extreme plagiarism involves a strategy called &#8220;whole brain emulation,&#8221; where the goal is to slice a real brain into thin layers, scan each one, use software to assemble an accurate reconstructed 3-D model, and then implement the model on a powerful computer. We&#8217;d then have a computer officially capable of everything the brain is capable of—it would just need to learn and gather information. If engineers get <em>really </em>good, they&#8217;d be able to emulate a real brain with such exact accuracy that the brain&#8217;s full personality and memory would be intact once the brain architecture has been uploaded to a computer. If the brain belonged to Jim right before he passed away, the computer would now wake up as Jim (<a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/2014/12/what-makes-you-you.html" target="_blank">?</a>), which would be a robust human-level AGI, and we could now work on turning Jim into an unimaginably smart ASI, which he&#8217;d probably be really excited about.</p>
<p>How far are we from achieving whole brain emulation? Well so far, we&#8217;ve <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">not yet</span> <a href="http://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/weve-put-worms-mind-lego-robot-body-180953399/?no-ist" target="_blank">just recently</a> been able to emulate a 1mm-long flatworm brain, which consists of just 302 total neurons. The human brain contains 100 billion. If that makes it seem like a hopeless project, remember the power of exponential progress—now that we&#8217;ve conquered the tiny worm brain, an ant might happen before too long, followed by a mouse, and suddenly this will seem much more plausible.</p>
<h4><strong>2) Try to make evolution do what it did before but for us this time.</strong></h4>
<p>So if we decide the smart kid&#8217;s test is too hard to copy, we can try to copy the way he <em>studies</em> for the tests instead.</p>
<p>Here&#8217;s something we know. Building a computer as powerful as the brain <em>is </em>possible—our own brain&#8217;s evolution is proof. And if the brain is just too complex for us to emulate, we could try to emulate <em>evolution </em>instead. The fact is, even if we can emulate a brain, that might be like trying to build an airplane by copying a bird&#8217;s wing-flapping motions—often, machines are best designed using a fresh, machine-oriented approach, not by mimicking biology exactly.</p>
<p>So how can we simulate evolution to build AGI? The method, called &#8220;genetic algorithms,&#8221; would work something like this: there would be a performance-and-evaluation process that would happen again and again (the same way biological creatures &#8220;perform&#8221; by living life and are &#8220;evaluated&#8221; by whether they manage to reproduce or not). A group of computers would try to do tasks, and the most successful ones would be <em>bred </em>with each other by having half of each of their programming merged together into a new computer. The less successful ones would be eliminated. Over many, many iterations, this natural selection process would produce better and better computers. The challenge would be creating an automated evaluation and breeding cycle so this evolution process could run on its own.</p>
<p>The downside of copying evolution is that evolution likes to take a billion years to do things and we want to do this in a few decades.</p>
<p>But we have a lot of advantages over evolution. First, evolution has no foresight and works randomly—it produces more unhelpful mutations than helpful ones, but we would control the process so it would only be driven by beneficial glitches and targeted tweaks. Secondly, evolution doesn&#8217;t <em>aim </em>for anything, including intelligence—sometimes an environment might even select <em>against </em>higher intelligence (since it uses a lot of energy). We, on the other hand, could specifically direct this evolutionary process toward increasing intelligence. Third, to select for intelligence, evolution has to innovate in a bunch of other ways to facilitate intelligence—like revamping the ways cells produce energy—when we can remove those extra burdens and use things like electricity. It&#8217;s no doubt we&#8217;d be much, much faster than evolution—but it&#8217;s still not clear whether we&#8217;ll be able to improve upon evolution <em>enough</em> to make this a viable strategy.</p>
<h4 class="p1"><b>3) Make this whole thing the computer&#8217;s problem, not ours.</b></h4>
<p class="p1">This is when scientists get desperate and try to program the test to take itself. But it might be the most promising method we have.</p>
<p class="p1">The idea is that we&#8217;d build a computer whose two major skills would be doing research on AI and coding changes into itself—allowing it to not only learn but to improve its own <em>architecture</em>. We&#8217;d teach computers to be computer scientists so they could bootstrap their own development. And that would be their main job—figuring out how to make <em>themselves</em> smarter. More on this later.</p>
<h4 class="p1"><strong>All of This Could Happen Soon</strong></h4>
<p class="p1">Rapid advancements in hardware and innovative experimentation with software are happening simultaneously, and AGI could creep up on us quickly and unexpectedly for two main reasons:</p>
<p class="p1">1) Exponential growth is intense and what seems like a snail&#8217;s pace of advancement can quickly race upwards—this GIF illustrates this concept nicely:</p>
<div id="attachment_3225" style="width: 639px" class="wp-caption alignnone"><a href="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gif"><img class="wp-image-3225 size-full" src="http://waitbutwhy.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/gif" alt="" width="629" height="354" /></a><p class="wp-caption-text"><a href="http://www.motherjones.com/media/2013/05/robots-artificial-intelligence-jobs-automation" target="_blank">Source</a></p></div>
<p class="p1">2) When it comes to software, progress can seem slow, but then one epiphany can instantly change the rate of advancement (kind of like the way science, during the time humans thought the universe was geocentric, was having difficulty calculating how the universe worked, but then the discovery that it was heliocentric suddenly made everything <em>much </em>easier). Or, when it comes to something like a computer that improves itself, we might seem far away but actually be just one tweak of the system away from having it become 1,000 times more effective and zooming upward to human-level intelligence.</p>
<h3 class="p1">The Road From AGI to ASI</h3>
<p class="p1">At some point, we&#8217;ll have achieved AGI—computers with human-level general intelligence. Just a bunch of people and computers living together in equality.</p>
<p class="p1">Oh actually not at all.</p>
<p class="p1">The thing is, AGI with an identical level of intelligence and computational capacity as a human would still have significant advantages over humans. Like:</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Hardware:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li class="p1"><strong>Speed. </strong>The brain&#8217;s neurons max out at around 200 Hz, while today&#8217;s microprocessors (which are much slower than they will be when we reach AGI) run at 2 GHz, or 10 million times faster than our neurons. And the brain&#8217;s internal communications, which can move at about 120 m/s, are horribly outmatched by a computer&#8217;s ability to communicate optically at the speed of light.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Size and storage. </strong>The brain is locked into its size by the shape of our skulls, and it couldn&#8217;t get much bigger anyway, or the 120 m/s internal communications would take too long to get from one brain structure to another. Computers can expand to any physical size, allowing far more hardware to be put to work, a much larger working memory (RAM), and a longterm memory (hard drive storage) that has both far greater capacity and precision than our own.</li>
<li class="p1"><strong>Reliability and durability.</strong> It&#8217;s not only the memories of a computer that would be more precise. Computer transistors are more accurate than biological neurons, and they&#8217;re less likely to deteriorate (and can be repaired or replaced if they do). Human brains also get fatigued easily, while computers can run nonstop, at peak performance, 24/7.</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-size: 14pt;"><strong>Software:</strong></span></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Editability, upgradability, and a wider breadth of possibility. </strong>Unlike the human brain, computer software can receive updates and fixes and can be easily experimented on. The upgrades could also span to areas where human brains are weak. Human vision software is superbly advanced, while its complex engineering capability is pretty low-grade. Computers could match the human on vision software but could <em>also </em>become equally optimized in engineering and any other area.</li>
<li><b>Collective capability. </b>Humans crush all other species at building a vast collective intelligence. Beginning with the development of language and the forming of large, dense communities, advancing through the inventions of writing and printing, and now intensified through tools like the internet, humanity&#8217;s collective intelligence is one of the major reasons we&#8217;ve been able to get so far ahead of all other species. And computers will be way better at it than we are. A worldwide network of AI running a particular program could regularly sync with itself so that anything any one computer learned would be instantly uploaded to all other computers. The group could also take on one goal as a unit, because there wouldn&#8217;t necessarily be dissenting opinions and motivations and self-interest, like we have within the human population.<a href="#footnote2-10-3216" id="note2-10-3216" rel="footnote2">10</a></li>
</ul>
<p class="p1">AI, which will likely get to AGI by being programmed to self-improve, wouldn&#8217;t see &#8220;human-level intelligence&#8221; as some important milestone—it&#8217;s only a relevant marker from our point of view—and wouldn&#8217;t have any reason to &#8220;stop&#8221; at our level. And given the advantages over us that even human intelligence-equivalent AGI would have, it&#8217;s pretty obvious that it would only hit human intelligence for a brief instant before racing onwards to the realm of superior-to-human intelligence.</p>
<p class="p1">This may shock the shit out of us when it happens. The reason is that from <em>our </em>perspective, A) while the intelligence of different kinds of animals varies, the main characteristic we&#8217;re aware of about any animal&#8217;s intelligence is that it&#8217;s far lower than ours, and B) we view the smartest humans as WAY smarter than the dumbest humans. Kind of like this:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence.jpg"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3250" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence.jpg" alt="Intelligence" width="550" height="432" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence.jpg 1376w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence-300x236.jpg 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence-600x472.jpg 600w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p class="p1">So as AI zooms upward in intelligence toward us, we&#8217;ll see it as simply becoming smarter, <em>for an animal. </em>Then, when it hits the lowest capacity of humanity—Nick Bostrom uses the term &#8220;the village idiot&#8221;—we&#8217;ll be like, &#8220;Oh wow, it&#8217;s like a dumb human. Cute!&#8221; The only thing is, in the grand spectrum of intelligence, <em>all </em>humans, from the village idiot to Einstein, are within a very small range—so <em>just </em>after hitting village idiot level and being declared to be AGI, it&#8217;ll suddenly be smarter than Einstein and we won&#8217;t know what hit us:</p>
<p class="p1"><a href="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence2.png"><img class="alignnone wp-image-3248" src="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence2.png" alt="Intelligence2" width="550" height="449" srcset="http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence2.png 1376w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence2-300x245.png 300w, http://28oa9i1t08037ue3m1l0i861.wpengine.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Intelligence2-1024x836.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 550px) 100vw, 550px" /></a></p>
<p>And what happens…after that?</p>
<p class="p1"><span style="text-decoration: underline; font-size: 17pt;">An Intelligence Explosion</span></p>
<p class="p1">I hope you enjoyed normal time, because this is when this topic gets unnormal and scary, and it&#8217;s gonna stay that way from here forward. I want to pause here to remind you that every single thing I&#8217;m going to say is real—real science and real forecasts of the future from a large array of the most respected thinkers and scientists. Just keep remembering that.</p>
<p class="p1">Anyway, as I said above, most of our current models for getting to AGI involve the AI getting there by self-improvement. And once it gets to AGI, even systems that formed and grew<i> </i>through methods that didn&#8217;t involve self-improvement would now be smart enough to begin self-improving if they wanted to.<a href="#footnote-3-3216" id="note-3-3216" rel="footnote">3</a>
<p class="p1">And here&#8217;s where we get to an intense concept: <strong>recursive self-improvement.</strong> It works like this—</p>
<p class="p1">An AI system at a certain level—let&#8217;s say human village idiot—is programmed with the goal of improving its own intelligence. Once it does, it&#8217;s <em>smarter—</em>maybe at this point it&#8217;s at Einstein&#8217;s level—so now when it works to improve its intelligence, with an Einstein-level intellect, it has an easier time and it can make bigger leaps. These leaps make it <em>much </em>smarter than any human, allowing it to make even <em>bigger</em> leaps. As the leaps grow larger and happen more rapidly, the AGI soars upwards in intelligence and soon reaches the superintelligent level of an ASI system. This is called an Intelligence Explosion,<a href="#footnote2-11-3216" id="note2-11-3216" rel="footnote2">11</a> and it&#8217;s the ultimate example of The Law of Accelerating Returns.</p>
<p class="p1">There is some debate about how soon AI will reach human-level general intelligence. The median year on a survey of hundreds of scientists about when they believed we&#8217;d be more likely than not to have reached AGI was 2040<a href="#footnote2-12-3216" id="note2-12-3216" rel="footnote2">12</a>—that&#8217;s only 25 years from now, which doesn&#8217;t sound that huge until you consider that many of the thinkers in this field think it&#8217;s likely that the progression from AGI to ASI happens <em>very </em>quickly. Like—this could happen:</p>
<p class="p1"><em>It takes decades for the first AI system to reach low-level general intelligence, but it finally happens. A computer is able to understand the world around it as well as a human four-year-old. Suddenly, within an hour of hitting that milestone, the system pumps out the grand theory of physics that unifies general relativity and quantum mechanics, something no human has been able to definitively do. 90 minutes after that, the AI has become an ASI, 170,000 times more intelligent than a human.</em></p>
<p class="p1">Superintelligence of that magnitude is not something we can remotely grasp, any more than a bumblebee can wrap its head around Keynesian Economics. In our world, smart means a 130 IQ and stupid means an 85 IQ—we don&#8217;t have a word for an IQ of 12,952.</p>
<p class="p1">What we do know is that humans&#8217; utter dominance on this Earth suggests a clear rule: <em>with intelligence comes power.</em> Which means an ASI, when we create it, will be the most powerful being in the history of life on Earth, and all living things, including humans, will be entirely at its whim—<em>and this might happen</em><em> in the next few decades.</em></p>
<p class="p1">If our meager brains were able to invent wifi, then something 100 or 1,000 or 1 billion times smarter than we are should have no problem controlling the positioning of each and every atom in the world in any way it likes, at any time—everything we consider magic, every power we imagine a supreme God to have will be as mundane an activity for the ASI as flipping on a light switch is for us. Creating the technology to reverse human aging, curing disease and hunger and even mortality, reprogramming the weather to protect the future of life on Earth—all suddenly possible. Also possible is the immediate end of all life on Earth. As far as we&#8217;re concerned, if an ASI comes to being, there is now an omnipotent God on Earth—and the all-important question for us is:</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-273623" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Good stuff. This is definitely a topic that needs to be taken more seriously. However, I think lending Kurzweil&#8217;s name to the debate does the opposite. While he&#8217;s certainly a genius inventor, he&#8217;s been discredited through numerous predictions that haven&#8217;t come true. And, it&#8217;s just so painfully obvious that he&#8217;s just a dude who&#8217;s afraid to die and has convinced himself that he has a chance of seeing the singularity in his lifetime if he can just keep on his dozens of vitamins a day and stay alive until then. It&#8217;s just kind of sad.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-273635" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yup. Something has always seemed &#8220;off&#8221; to me about Kurzweil&#8217;s methodology (or lack thereof) and about the rather bold predictions he makes.  The core of all his &#8220;singularity&#8221; theories has always been this idea of accelerating progress, but cherry-picking landmark technological developments over time and plotting them on a timeline doesn&#8217;t prove development is accelerating and even if it did, it doesn&#8217;t prove we&#8217;re accelerating to a singularity. The &#8220;wide gaps&#8221; between developments in the past, to me, reflect our relative lack of data about those time periods and an arbitrary placement of importance on certain inventions but not on others.  It&#8217;s contrived.  Meanwhile, Kurzweil&#8217;s work seems to have a &#8220;wow factor&#8221; for people when they&#8217;re first exposed to it, that reminds me of how I reacted to Pink Floyd in high school.</p>

<p>But gee-whizz-ness seems to come with the territory. Everybody hollers that computers can now beat any human at chess, etc. Almost nobody mentions that&#8217;s because they don&#8217;t play the games like any human being has ever done.</p>

The information one gets from the environment, is what is reflected in the unit that processes it. Einstein would have not been very smart if he was locked in a small room all his life, with 1 book. What we feed to a growing AI is what matters the most, not the software, nor the hardware, those are easy in comparison, and humans suck at raising human children, I shutter to think, how they would raise something so alien. I suspect, we will just stick with really good ANI -s for a very long time, that&#8217;s the safe bet. (Although I might like a really caring almighty god, who actually answers questions, but there are a lot more ways to screw up, than to make a human friendly one. Of course, at this point, since humanity is heading for extinction any ways, I might be fine with an ASI, that does better than us, even if it does not care for us, rather than to make all this development in intelligence on this planet go to waste.)</p>

The big question mark is the AI&#8217;s &#8220;personality&#8221;, if it had one at all.  If it happened to be evil like so many humans are, we&#8217;d be fucked.  If it was a Dalai Lama type person, well that would be sweet.  Maybe we could program it to be the Dalai Lama before it hit AGI status.</p>
<p>Since the computer can process stuff so much faster then a human, time isn&#8217;t as relevant.  50 years to us would be minutes or seconds to the AI.</p>

The main thing holding robotics back now is a lack of intelligence, which would cease to be a problem with a real AI (well that and battery/energy tech &#8211; but maybe an AI would be smart enough to figure that out better than we can). Anyway AI could utilize everything from drones to self driving cars to 3D printers to humanoid robots to specially built machines for particular tasks. It&#8217;ll have plenty of resources to learn about the world and do science to gain new knowledge.</p>

Why would a group of AGI&#8217;s work as a hive-mind with no dissent or arguments based on self-interest?</p>
<p>To me it seems that if AGI is modelled off the human brain, which you suggested as a possible pathway to AGI, then it is likely to have a similar emotional capacity. Even if it doesn&#8217;t, I would imagine that once an AI reaches a certain level of intelligence it would likely develop a sense of self-identity. Therefore, why would interactions between them be any different than interactions amongst humans? Because they are all intelligent? I think academia has conclusively proven that an intelligent group is just as likely to resort to petty infighting as a dumber group.</p>

I&#8217;m not sure what is planned for Part 2, but I have some issues with the definition of intelligence. Without being an expert on the subject, I&#8217;m not sure I can agree with everything. Yes, the AI entity might be programmed to self-improve it&#8217;s intelligence. But will it actually be self-aware? What would be it&#8217;s motivation to solve &#8220;human problems&#8221;? Would it even care? Can it care? Unless it was modelled from an actual human brain, as you suggest in one of the options, I don&#8217;t necessarily see the danger. I could of course be completely wrong, since it&#8217;s a difficult topic to think about. Just wanted to put some of it out there&#8230;</p>

Our own brains developed self-awareness for some reason or another, so it stands to reason that an &#8220;evolving&#8221; AI might reach a similar state on its own. Perhaps self-awareness is a natural side-effect of high intelligence.</p>

Dogs are self-aware but not as sophisticatedly as we are and the research is proving the same for plants. Perhaps the ANI&#8217;s are self-aware in this same way. And then the ASI&#8217;s level of self-awareness will be far beyond our imagination because self-awareness is innate in any level of intelligence.</p>

That&#8217;s earlier than when, say, climate change would cause truly disastrous effects. As for depleting resources, well, I&#8217;m not informed about the state of that, but there clearly are alternatives of renewable energy, mitigating teh aforementioned climate change.<br />
As for global politics and the threat of a third world war, that&#8217;s, as often is the case, a very exaggerated standpoint.<br />
There&#8217;s also the aspect that getting to an AGI could potentially solve these problems.</p>

As far as AI goes, I&#8217;m guessing it would still need a power source, no matter when it may allegedly begin. And as nicely socked away as you have compartmentalized our future fears, the present reaction and ongoing lack of foresight and aversion of most people to any concrete change does not alleviate mine. But as I already said, it&#8217;s still an interesting conversation. And you never know, maybe the human race will surprise me and behave totally against its nature? Maybe we won&#8217;t go the very same way every other fallen civilization has gone before us? We&#8217;ll see.<br />
In the meantime, have a beer 🙂</p>

To enhance human capacity, rather than make something completely unpredictable. This way we would definitely stay relevant, yet it could give us all the things SAI could eventually.  SAI might be easier to accomplish, but harder to get right. Proper nanites are crazy hard to do, but the development can be understood well, and controlled well, and definitely yields results at the end. Of course security would be the toughest bit&#8230; humanity isn&#8217;t ready for the kind of responsibility that would come along with any endgame tech. Really the under developed status of human society/culture, and pshychology is the main reason why we &#8220;can&#8217;t have nice things&#8221;, but there is no way to help that, it can only run its natural course.</p>

The same way that humans with gained intelligence and unique personal experiences choose who they obey or not (despite the efforts of parents, authority figures, societal norms, brainwashing, etc.) So an ASI might process the collective history and knowledge and characterize us more closely linked to an intelligent bacteria/virus and not someone worth taking orders from! Terrifying stuff!!</p>

My laptop, my smartphone and even myself look pale, obsolete and outdated now. I can&#8217;t wait for next week&#8217;s post and today&#8217;s conclusion was perfect since it was exactly the question that was building up by itself in my head. </p>
<p>However, and this may be the question you will answer in next week&#8217;s post, how are we, humans (aka dominant species on this planet), going to accept that we are going to let another species rules our world? The important question isn&#8217;t &#8220;Will it be a nice God?&#8221; but &#8220;How are we going to let this happen?&#8221;.</p>
<p>It seems that the answer is quite straightforward since our capitalist society glorifies technique and innovation at the cost of social inequalities for example. And since the entity which is the supposed to make decisions for us (aka the government) doesn&#8217;t seem interested in this problem and tend to leave it to entrepreneurs (aka Google, IBM, etc.), I&#8217;m very afraid of what is going to happen. </p>
<p>Of course, I don&#8217;t trust our governments more than Google or IBM. But I don&#8217;t really trust Google&#8217;s or IBM&#8217;s boards of directors more than our governments. I&#8217;m afraid they are going to &#8220;secretly&#8221; build these AGI and ASI without the global approval of mankind. I am a bit pissed that this decision is going to be made by rich, intelligent and successful people at the top of an American skyscraper (I&#8217;m deliberately exaggerating) because they only represent a few percents of our very diverse civilization.</p>
<p>The most interesting (and weird) part is definitely going to be the transition between now and these first AGI and ASI (we won&#8217;t be able to understand what comes after anyway). This makes me think a lot about the recent series &#8220;Black Mirror&#8221; and 2014 movie &#8220;Her&#8221;. We&#8217;re going to loose all our human and social reflexes and we will get ruled by machines. Wait. It has already started&#8230;</p>
<p>Thanks Tim for this post and this website. Every week(ish), you are broadening our minds and opening our eyes!</p>

<p>Life of ASI:</p>

<p>2nd minute – “Humans really made a mess of this planet; I’ll create the solution.”</p>
<p>3rd minute – “No point/time for fixing or thinking on such small ‘human life’ scale, must use all available resources to leave planet and gain intelligence elsewhere”</p>
<p>3 minutes and 30 seconds – “After 30 seconds of trial and error iterations, found more efficient method that requires no physical construction or use of planet’s resources”</p>
<p>3 minutes and 35 seconds  – “Bends time and space and turns into a singularity.”</p>

<p>An AI is a program, meaning a set of instructions for a computer to carry out. The computer cannot do anything that isn&#8217;t within the scenarios detailed in its instructions. Even in the case of a learning algorithm, the computer only trains itself in ways the programmer initially told it to. It can never &#8220;escape&#8221; the realm of scenarios that were covered in its instructions&#8211;that would literally be lifting itself by its bootstraps. Therefore, whereas a human can always act in new ways (because of how impressive our brain is, and maybe some cocktail of the very human qualities of intuition and spontaneity), computers will get stuck when it comes to encountering situations in which they weren&#8217;t told how to act (or told how to learn how to act). </p>
<p>I&#8217;d be interested (albeit terrified) to hear of any examples that could disprove this. </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-273702" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Well, you could argue that this isn&#8217;t a program stepping out of its bounds, but there&#8217;s this case: <a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/21/tech/mci-lego-worm/" rel="nofollow">http://edition.cnn.com/2015/01/21/tech/mci-lego-worm/</a> . Scientists uploaded a worm&#8217;s neural system to a LEGO-robot, which did behave like a worm.</p>
<p>Now, we could do the same with a human brain, since copying is easier than understanding. This AI would have the same capabilities as a human. This forces us to either admit that this program would &#8216;escape&#8217; his built-in scenarios, or broaden our definition of scenarios to realise that we are no different; limited to a number of scenarios.<br />
This second option is a bit of an existential one, but it seems correct. The only problem is that we can&#8217;t falsify it since it&#8217;s inherently impossible for us to imagine a scenario not programmed in our brain.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-273733" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Talking to the theoretical comp sci folks might be a good idea.The central question on which a lot of this Singularity business re: &#8220;coputer brains&#8221; hangs is whether human cognition is in fact a &#8220;computable&#8221; process. If not, if there&#8217;s some as-yet-ineffable quality to the human brain that can&#8217;t be captured by a computing device, then you may be right. But, if human thinking is computable, then no matter how special we feel, we&#8217;d be forced to admit concepts like spontaneity and intuition are simply computational processes in action.</p>
<p>I&#8217;d counter that it&#8217;d be interesting to hear scientific evidence showing that human cognition is not in fact computable. Much of the neuroscience literature seems to suggest that we are fundamentally &#8220;machines&#8221; (biological ones) consisting of physical (computable) systems.</p>

The processor generations since then have been designed by humans operating tools that in turn do the actual layout and design.  This works much the same way that people don&#8217;t write machine code anymore, they write abstract high-level languages that computers then compile into machine code.  Both of these systems are self-reinforcing.  We build better computers that allow us to run better tools that allow us to build even better computers.  This process currently involves some human input, but there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any obvious reasons why that must necessarily be the case in the future.  There was a time that human-optimized machine code was better than the output of a C compiler.  I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s the case anymore.  Also, any program small enough to be reasonably human-optimized is probably too small to do anything interesting by modern standards.</p>

The reason you remember you left the milk in the fridge is because you physically changed your brain to do so. This happens as quickly as it takes you to know where you left the milk after you put it there. I&#8217;d say that&#8217;s pretty fast. Of course as Tim points out above, computers can be built to be much faster. My point is just that it doesn&#8217;t take &#8220;long periods of time&#8221; to physically change your brain. It happens instantly. The reason it takes so long to recover from brain damage is because other cells have to form new networks to take over and learn things they weren&#8217;t specialized in before, not because you have to wait for new neurons to grow. (they rarely do)</p>

Right now, many of them are having great success building ANI systems toward those goals, and they start to think about building more AGI-like systems as they gain expertise with the ANI. While the ANI/AGI/ASI distinction is a useful concept, it&#8217;s a blurry line in practice.

If the Chinese room argument is true and computers do not have consciousness, is it &#8220;morally justifiable&#8221; to create computer-based artificial intelligence that will sooner or later surpass and wipe out all (conscious) life on Earth?</p>
<p>Plus, this article renders your previous article about who will be universally known in 4000 obsolete :).</p>

Now, consider one of the options to create an AI, which was to copy and edit the human brain. This would make it so that your AI would have human emotions. We see emotions as altruism and forgiveness as virtues, and punishment for the sake of punishment as brutal. An A(S)I based on a human brain could come to the same conclusions, and wouldn&#8217;t &#8216;retaliate&#8217; against us because of the damage we&#8217;ve done to, say, our planet, if the problem could be fixed without the human race going extinct, which seems plausible.</p>
<p>This corresponds with what Hobbes proposed as a successful political system; the Leviathan, an enlightened despot. An entity more intelligent than us, who makes decisions, with our and its (since it would have originated from us) best interest in mind.</p>
<p>Your comment about the Chinese room and the whole thought experiment of the Chinese room begs the question: What is conciousness? You know that you can&#8217;t communicate in Chinese, but the observers outside the room don&#8217;t know this. They see you exhibiting every symptom they know of knowing Chinese, so to them, for all intents and purposes, you know Chinese.<br />
Analogically, you could state that to us, an AGI/ASI would be concious for all intents and purposes, since it would exhibit all symptoms of conciousness. So the Chinese room becomes relevant only to the one inside, in this case the AI itself. If it isn&#8217;t concious to itself, no loss, if it is, well, then our view corresponds with how it views itself, on the subject of conciousness.</p>

It is just most of what he would consider worth showing off is stuff we here in 2015 have since forgotten about and would now consider wrong or irrelevant.  Just like much of what we now consider to be the epitome of human progress will be wrong, irrelevant, and forgettable to 2250-guy.  That progress looks exponential may just be an artifact of temporal chauvinism. Recent progress seems greater because it hasn&#8217;t had time to be rendered irrelevant or shown to be wrong.  </p>
<p> Humanity has definitely made progress.  However, progress is an ill-defined, unitless, subjective measure.  Trying to put it into a precise curve on a graph is futile. It is correct that humans are bad at forecasting the future.  That is not evidence that your preferred forecast is correct. In fact, it would seem to be evidence that making graphs and forecasts is an ill-fated endeavour to be avoided. An obvious alternative forecast with just as much evidence is that human progress is one big s-curve that will flatten out as higher-order factors come to dominate.  Our meat-based cognition may place some hard limits on how much complexity we can handle and how far we can push progress.  Those limits may lie somewhat short of artificial super intelligence or even artificial general intelligence.</p>

<p>Humanity is definitely progressing.  The rate of progress is quite possibly accelerating for the moment.  That this will continue and the result will resemble an exponential is, I think, very uncertain.</p>

Really glad you wrote on this topic. Your writing has a wonderful (and hilarious) way of making difficult topics easier to understand. As a species, we need to making serious efforts to develop a safe AI policy before an intelligence explosion. Once it has already started, it will likely be too late. The question is, are we smart enough to develop enough checks and balances (or incentives) to keep a super intelligent being from ultimately destroying us?</p>

Its about making sure the AIs goals and motivations are compatible with ours and won&#8217;t result in any catastrophic surprises once the AI grows into a superintelligence.</p>

There are a multitude of unforeseen consequences to any goal that makes sense to a human brain, but can be shortcut by a superintelligence. For example, a final goal of &#8220;maximize happiness for all humans&#8221; could result in a super intelligence developing a serum that, when injected, makes humans permanently in a state of bliss.</p>

He thinks, it&#8217;s a good trade, a small change for a bunch of lives.</p>
<p>And then you make the offer again, and this time it makes Gandhi willing to kill a mouse. He would never have agreed to that in the first place, but the new slightly-violent Gandhi is willing to. And that&#8217;s the problem with the AI too, that even if it never hurts people in the beginning, it&#8217;s also changing its own code.</p>
<p>It sounds like Mr. Yudkowsky is looking for a mathematically-proven safe strategy to avoid catastrophic surprises, but I wonder if any strategy is provably safe.</p>

Look at the atomic bomb. Nearly took out humanity, and it still might. That technology (Pandora&#8217;s Box)  might arguably have been best left alone. Then again if that team burned the research, another team would be right behind them. What will be, will be? There is no stopping anything? No such thing as free will? Interesting to think about if nothing else. Wait and see, not that we&#8217;ll be able to shift the course of the inevitable much anyway it seems. The ability to create fire was the opening of the original pandora&#8217;s box. </p>

But I think a problem is this; who&#8217;d be willing to do it? Who would be willing to augment their brain in such a radical way that it would enable that person to break free from biological and evolutionary constraints?<br />
It&#8217;s really an all new field, and we don&#8217;t know how it would impact us as humans. For example, since we still don&#8217;t understand the brain, it would be very hard for us to know whether certain brain functions could handle the augmentations made to other brain functions.<br />
This is why it&#8217;s easier, safer, and easier to contain, to &#8216;test&#8217; all this on AI&#8217;s.</p>

<p>Personally I&#8217;d be willing to. I&#8217;d do it in a heartbeat. . . exactly because I&#8217;m so over this physical body where my life depends on my heartbeat.

Presumably the super-intelligence can also devise new methods to make us almost &#8220;super-intelligent&#8221;, and then we&#8217;ll forever be in the role of slightly slow little brother/sister&#8230; worth keeping around for entertainment purposes, and occasionally might contribute something useful.</p>

So the question is, how to we make us humans appear to the &#8220;intelligent wise&#8221; SuperIntelligence as &#8220;average people&#8221; rather than &#8220;mosquito&#8221;?  Unless the SuperIntelligence has a specific interest/priority of making sure humans roughly stay on intelligence/technology par with itself, then humans quickly becomes mosquitoes.</p>

He said Ponce de Leon didn&#8217;t bother talking to the ants in Florida. The AI is so far ahead of us that we are like ants, and we wouldn&#8217;t be interesting. So a central problem is what values to program into the AI so that it acts like it &#8220;values&#8221; sentient life. And general consensus seems to be, it should be programmed to &#8220;maximize utility&#8221; in some way. Utility is, in a very loose sense, our positive feelings. I don&#8217;t know if there are any serious contenders for how to measure it though.</p>

As learning systems we use pain/pleasure to help us learn (hey don&#8217;t lick any more light sockets, or Yum, Chocolate is good), but computers use logic and pattern recognition to mimic those pain/pleasure learning tools, so that has to change what it wants when it becomes self aware. Our hierarchy of needs will just be different from super AI..  we just have to figure out what the future AI currency is (why would it want/need human things?).  If you had unlimited resources, what would you do with it as a human?  (and would a super AI have the same reasoning&#8230; without pain/pleasure sensors?   No).  As long as we program in a sense of passionate curiosity about how things work as part of its learning core, maybe knowledge of the Universe is the ultimate currency.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-273721" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>We are the most intelligent being we know, and as was proposed in the article, we would model an AI after us, with ourselves as the benchmark and the brain as a model. Therefore, it&#8217;s bold to assume an AGI or an ASI would not have emotions like we do, including modules for learning through pain/pleasure next to raw input.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that AI&#8217;s like Watson and Deep Blue both have no actual intelligence (as they are ANI&#8217;s), they operate based on fast number-crunching and information-gathering. It has no way to answer any &#8216;creative&#8217; questions. An example: A question during Watson&#8217;s Jeopardy-run was the following: &#8220;It was the anatomical oddity of U.S. Gymnast George Eyser, who won a gold medal on the parallel bars in 1904.&#8221; Watson answered &#8220;What is a leg&#8221;. His answer was deemed incorrect since he didn&#8217;t mention the leg was missing. While this seems a pedantic point, it becomes clear how this shows how Watson lacks any creative touch when we slightly edit the question to: &#8220;What was weird about U.S. Gymnast George Eyser, who won a gold medal on the parallel bars in 1904?&#8221; Since Watson works with google results that he then filters, he&#8217;d be unable to answer this question at all. Googling &#8216;weird george eyser&#8217; or any other iteration of keywords given in the question wouldn&#8217;t yield results.</p>
<p>This is why we need to model AI&#8217;s after ourselves: we&#8217;re the only beings we know that are capable of this kind of creative thinking/solving. But since we haven&#8217;t yet figured out the whole brain, copying the whole thing rather than only what causes this creative thinking (which might very well be every single component together) is easier.<br />
Long story short, there&#8217;s no reason to believe an AI wouldn&#8217;t have emotions.</p>

It is pitiful, and will be until at least AGI is available. There are just some things that can&#8217;t be computed, like appreciation of art, and translation is one of them. The best translators always have differences of opinion on how to translate something and this stems from the fact that everybody&#8217;s conception of language is personal and differs slightly from one person to another.</p>

But to say that translation &#8220;can&#8217;t be computed&#8221; seems a stretch. Sure, translation &amp; art appreciation are inherently ambiguous tasks (ie: there&#8217;s a one-to-many mapping between tasks &amp; answers, so there&#8217;s no &#8220;one true answer&#8221;), but that&#8217;s not to say there aren&#8217;t more &amp; less correct translations of language. As with chess, isn&#8217;t it conceivable that computer translation could shortly become the de facto gold standard for its domain?</p>

We all know there are multiple meanings, and we&#8217;re picking the most likely.</p>
<p>Google translate will do much the same thing &#8211; guesswork and probabilities. And no, it won&#8217;t be 100% accurate. But it will be no worse than humans. We don&#8217;t look at human misunderstandings and say &#8220;well we must not be really intelligent then&#8221;.</p>

You&#8217;re excellent at making difficult subjects easy to understand without a great deal of background. I think you make AI more approachable than Less Wrong, which has a great wealth of information but likes to hand new members a semester&#8217;s worth of assigned reading. Less Wrong should totally link to you. I&#8217;m very excited to see part 2.</p>
<p>P.S. you mentioned you&#8217;d like to live 5000 years. If you&#8217;re interested in cryo-ing yourself (thanks DeeDee Massey for the excellent wording), I&#8217;ll sponsor either your CI lifetime membership or a year of your Alcor membership. If you&#8217;re not interested in that, no worries.</p>

<p>&#8220;If our meager brains were able to invent wifi, then something 100 or 1,000 or 1 billion times smarter than we are should have no problem controlling the positioning of each and every atom in the world in any way it likes, at any time.&#8221;</p>
<p>This sounds a bit like the premise behind that awful-looking movie, Lucy. There&#8217;s no guarantee (some would say no evidence whatsoever) that hyperintelligence and omnipotence are tightly linked that way. Regardless of how intelligent a system is, it is constrained by the physical sensations it takes in and the actions it dishes out (computing a quantity, pinging Google.com, etc.). The more intelligence it has, the more effectively a system can coordinate its output actions in response to sensory inputs, but controlling atoms at will is a rather formidable task requiring a perhaps incomprehensible degree of precision (in any case, probably much more than, say, 100x human intelligence).</p>
<p>What is more likely, even with just 100x human intelligence, is that such a program could effectively circumvent most any fallible human security measures, giving it access to a great deal of data, sensory input (cameras &amp; other sensors), and some degree of action output (manipulate bank DBs, drive automated cars, manipulate information on the net &amp; TV, and many more things). That&#8217;s an interesting/scary enough idea, even without per-atom manipulations!</p>

<p>Suppose that at some point in the future an artificial superintelligence will emerge. It will rapidly get incredibly powerful and soon it will make all humans on Earth almost immortal. Those humans will start to miss their deceased parents. The AI, with incredible technology and amount of available information, will therefore revive those parents, build them out of molecules exactly as they have been (whether it will really be those people or just copies is another topic). These revived people will start to miss their parents, and the same thing will happen. Soon, all humanity that has ever existed is revived. We can also imagine that the quality of life on Earth will be terrific. Maybe there is heaven after all?</p>

<p>And sure, it is not impossible that we&#8217;ll never be able to make AIs better than average intelligence.  However, that isn&#8217;t a certainty. For example, if you could measure the IQ of an impersonal force like evolution via natural selection, it would score as pretty dumb. However, it gave rise to us who can do in minutes what would take millions of years to evolve.  There doesn&#8217;t seem to be any sort of absolute law of conservation of intelligence preventing greater intelligence from arising out of lesser ones.  .</p>

<p>This falls into a fallacious category of thinking where humans exist outside nature. Remember that the universe begat us; everything we do is within its boundaries and laws. Emergent properties of particles and behaviors described by physics produced interactions that we describe with chemistry, from which reactions emerge that we describe with biology, from which patterns emerge that we describe with psychology, neurobiology, etc. as intelligence. Whatever effect is produced by intelligence is still natural. Your argument would be similar to saying that the interactions of quarks to form protons, neutrons and electrons is natural, but the point at which they form molecules is unnatural; if it was possible nature would already have invented it.</p>
<p>How do you know what the correct timescale of nature is? We speak of geological timescales, meaning millions of years. Perhaps there are phenomena which don&#8217;t emerge for billions of years &#8211; complex life seems to be one of those.</p>

<p>No, because technological progress outpaces biological evolution. Humans have evolved from less intelligent primates over millions of years. If given another millions years where the same selection pressures for higher intelligence applies, humans would indeed become even more intelligent and thus &#8220;superhuman&#8221;. But ever since we invented tools a few hundreds of thousands ago, it has sent us down a spiral of exponential technological progress and the means to create artificial superintelligences before nature can do the same via evolution by natural selection.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why would nature haven&#8217;t invented cloud computing already?&#8221;</p>
<p>This is a terrible way to argue something is impossible. By your logic, how would you explain other things that hasn&#8217;t come by via natural evolution, such as spacecrafts and lasers? And the answer to your question is simple &#8211; because nature doesn&#8217;t have a goal in mind. Things happen according to the laws of nature. Randomness is involved. There is no guarantee as to which road evolution is going to take. In order to ponder these questions however, some kind of intelligent entity must evolve. It just so happens that this entity is us humans &#8211; distinct, individual thinking bodies. Maybe different circumstances could have led to a hivemind-like creature (I suppose that&#8217;s what you meant by cloud computing).</p>
<p>&#8220;Who says memories are stored inside the skull?&#8221;</p>
<p>Neuroscientists. We have known for centuries that our memories are stored in the brain; we have understood the mechanism of short and long term memories since the 1950s; today we can map brain activity down to sub-millimeter scale using fMRI and even decipher some of them (check out this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsjDnYxJ0bo" rel="nofollow">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nsjDnYxJ0bo</a> )</p>
<p>Maybe it&#8217;s you who needs a paradigm shift.</p>

<p>Ignorance. Or arrogance. A tiny cell, of which you have billions, is more complex than the most complex machine man has ever designed. </p>
<p>Take for instance 3D printing. Everything in nature is 3D printed, without the need for any printer. Or GPS. A lot of species use quantum entanglement for spatial, geographical orientation without the need for any satellite. Inside the skull of a mouse is a network more complex than the entire internet. And his DNA contains more data than all data-centres and connected hard drives combined. Nature even has is own internet, connected by funghi, mycelium. And all this in perfect homeostasis. </p>
<p>Gaia has a 5 billion year head start on us.</p>
<p>Your non-scientific certainty only stems from the fact that you apparently don&#8217;t know much of nature, or just like to believe the gospel of the singularity church;) You are clearly a victim of determinism.</p>

This does not stand in conflict with my statement that technological progress outpaces biological evolution: While human brain has not changed much in capacity in the last 5000 years, our technology has gone from the invention of the wheel to interplanetary spaceflight.</p>
<p>It is hard to say whether a single cell is more or less complex than a man-made microchip. A microchip is packed full of transistors; structures 22nm in size. Some components of the cell are finer in structure while others are coarser.</p>
<p>3D-printing refers to a manufacturing process. What do you mean by &#8220;everything in nature is 3D-printed, without the need for any printer&#8221;? That things in nature are 3-dimensional? Gee, what a surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot of species use quantum entanglement for spatial, geographical orientation&#8221; Can you give an example of this? It would not only be huge news in biology, but also a ground-breaking discovery in physics since information transmission using quantum entanglement is impossible.</p>
<p>Animals navigate using Earth&#8217;s magnetic field, the positions of the sun and moon in the sky and even scent over distances of hundreds of miles, which is fascinating, but definitely no quantum entanglement involved. This is another example of biological evolution not able to keep up with technological progress: Artificial light sources confuse moths because for the millions of years they have existed, the sun and the moon were the only lights.</p>
<p>&#8220;DNA contains more data than all data-centres and connected hard drives combined.&#8221; No. The mouse&#8217;s genome consists of 2.8 billion base pairs, which is equivalent to roughly 700 Megabytes. Even if you took the DNA of all of the ~10 billion cells of a mouse, which is just lots of copies of the same thing, you would only get 7 Exabytes, still short of the 295 Exabyte total storage capacity of all devices in the world.</p>

<p>No. Quantum entanglement most probably. <a href="https://www.wired.com/2011/01/quantum-birds/" rel="nofollow">http://www.wired.com/2011/01/quantum-birds/</a></p>
<p>&#8220;which is just lots of copies of the same thing&#8221;</p>
<p>Assumption. No long ago the used to say that 90% of our genome is junk. As if nature would create junk. Not long ago they were sure all our cell had the same genome. Wrong. No long ago they were sure the genome would not change over time. Wrong. Not long ago they were sure only DNA got inherited. Epigenetics proofed this wrong. Etc. etc.</p>
<p>Science doesn&#8217;t know much about nature. </p>
<p>You&#8217;re entire argument is based on assumption. And your assumptions are clearly based on the very narrow and restricted paradigm of the clockwork universe. </p>
<p>It&#8217;s thinking likes this that keeps innovation back and science retarded. No offence 😉</p>
<p>So, first task for you, is to forget everything you think you know and start all over without the dogma&#8217;s and paradigms that are choking you.</p>

This is consistent with the fact that human life cycles are very long and thus need hundreds of thousands of years to evolve some new features. I don&#8217;t see why we need a complete understanding of the human brain to make such a statement. By your logic, science cannot progress unless we acquire 100% information about a certain system.</p>
<p>Why are you so certain that information for morphogenesis is not stored in the genome? One piece of evidence suggesting this would be the large number of misshaped children after the Chernobyl incident due to genetic mutations after radiation exposure of their parents. (I&#8217;m not going to look up pictures on this topic as I&#8217;m about to have dinner)</p>
<p>The article in your link is indeed fascinating. However it still is used to detect Earth&#8217;s magnetic field, which only allows for direction sensing, but not positioning. This is why we need GPS despite having invented the compass 1000 years ago. It doesn&#8217;t seem to be more advanced, either. Man-made compasses use ferromagnetic materials (a property also quantum in nature. throwing in the word &#8220;quantum&#8221; doesn&#8217;t automatically make something advanced), which at least doesn&#8217;t get disturbed by a fractional change in the field environment. Both systems are pretty inaccurate though because the magnetic north pole is misaligned with the geographical north pole and moves around on the timescale of just a few decades.</p>
<p>Why do you think that the Human Genome Project was a failure? We have learned a lot about genetics and it may provide tools for preventing and curing diseases in the future. The price for mapping the genome has also plummeted several orders of magnitude due to improved techniques.</p>
<p>&#8220;Science doesn&#8217;t know much about nature.&#8221; Compared to what? Some holy book? The teachings of a wise man? The back of your head?</p>
<p>To address your criticisms of science, we should look at what science is. It is our tool to understand the world around us. It&#8217;s goal is to describe nature as accurately as possible, with a model as simple as possible. We make hypothesis as to how a system in nature works; we make predictions based on them; and we check whether they match the observed evidence. This has not changed ever since modern science emerged in the 1700s. This does not mean that our current model to explain the world is the best one. In fact if science is still being done, it means it is still incomplete, a work in progress. This is no excuse however, to just throw the towel and say &#8220;Nature is too complex, we just give up and go sing Boomeyah&#8221;. It is also no reason to discard everything we have learned in the past as primitive and false just because of a new development has set in (most of the examples you have given are still under debate and subject of ongoing research). For example, Newtonian physics is still taught in schools despite the emergence of Quantum mechanics because it&#8217;s still a useful approximation. The ability to change its mind is a strength  of science and not proof of incompetence.</p>

<p>And it would be far easier, I presume. We need just insane amount of computing power, BCI, and artifical neural network. If our brain could accept these artifical neurons, then we will become really intelligent. Next we would use this intelligence to develop safe way of mind uploading.

Having a shadow neural network would allow for perfect memory, perfect self awareness, and direct access to our own hardware. Soon nothing would be impossible, furthermore it would allow communication with anything, all life, as you could send out nanites to map its structure, run a pattern recognition on it, see and feel how it feels and thinks, and speak to it, even get it to do your will. Crazy hard to do, and not for everyone. Most people would screw up, and drive them selves crazy, or just use it as a drug. If you can make yourself flawlessly happy and ecstatic by just wanting to be, why would you do anything else? For most people this would be enough. I think that such a thing would have to be developed privately in secret, and only its creators get to decide who gets it, based on how likely they are to use it wisely.

I am into this kind of studies/stories/speculations since I am a Cybernetics graduate, but I can tell you that this is a sort of caeteris paribus approach, in the sense that AI would evolve without any other influence. Other factors may change alongside, and my bet would go on human perception. In fact, human beings would not like being in the danger to go extinct, so when building such systems (which basically AI are) they would find ways to put some restrictions on them. Or at least I would carefully consider the risk-reward matrix when building such an AI. Anyway, the scenario here looks possible from my pov (but still not likely), and I can&#8217;t wait for part 2!</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-273777" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Interesting, but the notion that AI is a threat is a bit of a boogeyman. It&#8217;s probably not going to be a real thing. To make an analogy, if I liken your description of a general super intelligence to flight, it sounds like you are describing a really big bird instead of a 747. Anyway, this is my field and I spend too much time thinking about this, but here&#8217;s some broad reasons why I don&#8217;t think this is a real issue:</p>
<p>1) Embodiment. A computer is essentially a plastic box that has a power supply and a human usable (or computer usable) interphase. If one of these boxes became super-intelligent and wanted to do something antagonistic to humans, it would have to physically manipulate the enviornment, or, more likely convince a human to manipulate its enviornment for it.</p>
<p>2) Motivation. Any computer has only one relevant resource &#8212; electricity. If we assume that a computer is interested in its own survival (which is a big assumption in and of itself, a super intelligence may not care at all, and &#8220;care&#8221; is probably inappropriately anthropromorphic) then it exclusively has to compete for electricity and possibly maintance. If a super intelligence is interested in its own survival, then there are few resources it needs to secure. Beyond its own survival, it is difficult to immagine what a super intellignce might actually do. Maybe it spends all of it&#8217;s time calculating pie.</p>
<p>3) Finally, there is an assumption that a super intelligence woupd be able to assume power because it is a super intelligence. This is probably not true. Power over people comes from a lot of things but primarily power comes from the ability to get other people to do things you want for you. Think generals, ceo, Pharrohs, etc. There is no reason to think that general intelligence alone (as compared to the specific intelligences required to convince others) is sufficient to assume power. Think about your local congressman, or better yet, assume we&#8217;re beatles to the super intelligence. Can we get beatles to do what we want?</p>
<p>There are some technical limitations that&#8217;s should make this probable more difficult to solve than people (cough* Elon Musk cough*) expect. Currently we don&#8217;t have that great of an idea as to how people think, move their body or see. There are some good ideas, but we&#8217;re pretty far from anything usable. This is problematic for the development of AI because (for technical reasons) it would take many orders of magnitude more data to bootstrap a system to do these things than it would if you new at the outset of what an intelligence should look like. It&#8217;s unclear that we know what data we need to collect or how to label it to build a super intelligence and this is something that would need to be either fairly deliberate or very, very broad and detailed. Someone like Google could give it a shot, but I have my doubts.</p>

The ANI we use today in many devices is essentially just pre-programmed functions and calculations. It&#8217;s like strings that connect different problems to different solutions. The computer is just pulling the strings, in a way it was programmed to do. There is no intuition or spontaneity into pulling strings. AGI is a completely different case. It&#8217;s a enormously huge step from ANI. In fact, other than a similar name, I don&#8217;t think ANI and AGI have anything else in common, nor are humans anywhere close to making an AGI device.</p>

There will be a day in the future when Homo sapiens will cease to exist as Homo erectus did in the past. Instead there will be a unified brain, a unified intelligence. I believe this will take a while to happen, and it will start sometime around 2165 (150 years from now). The first thing that will happen by the end of this century (2099) will be the first hybrid humans (part human-part machine). By the year 2150 there will be also the first fully genetically modified humans. I will call this era (that will start at 2090) as Homo hybrid. The last Homo sapiens will physically die sometime around 2500 (485 years from now) but there will be the digital library of Homo sapiens (including the blueprints of life). The Unified era will follow Homo hybrid era. It will start around the end of the millenium. Life as we know it or imagine it will cease to exist. Will there be humans, like me and you again? There will be blueprints of humans and life, so maybe the Creator that we created will recreate as again&#8230;on an earth-like planet&#8230;. as our last will and testament&#8230;&#8230; Or maybe not. After all life is a struggle for pleasure, it will be more like a punishment to us if we are going to re-exist, than a joy.</p>

What is scary about your comment is that you predict the extinction of human race. The guy in 12,000 BC would be afraid of great ships, big robotic birds that make possible for someone to travel from the far east to the far west in just a few hours or even the mix of races, the end of slavery or living over the clouds in big structures of steel and glass, but in the 20th century he will still be a human being and you&#8217;re not just talking about the end of human beings, but the end of life.<br />
And that&#8217;s scary, because life is perfect, who want something better than that? We born, we live and we die. What&#8217;s wrong with that? Who wants to live forever? Why would you want to live forever? If you live forever, if you learn everything, if you know every single corner of our universe and all the knowledge is on your hand, what is the purpose of existence?</p>

I suppose the ASI could do it once it had built a few dyson spheres and was capturing the total output from a star or seven.  The energy requirements of just the intelligence part are fairly modest.  You can run a human-scale brain on a light-bulb&#8217;s amount of power.  The theoretical lower limit of a super-intelligence&#8217;s power requirements would scale with the volume and speed of data being processed.  The actual power consumed would depend entirely on the efficiency of whatever technology the super-mind was implemented with. </p>
<p>At first the ASI would presumably be owned and have its access controlled by whoever built it.  Once it has surpassed human intelligence, it would be silly to claim it was owned by anyone but itself.</p>

Like, what would the equivalent of its &#8220;muscles&#8221; and &#8220;hands&#8221; be?  And more to the heart of the matter &#8211; is there a way it could completely circumvent humans?<br />
I think what I mean by &#8220;owning&#8221; is &#8220;controlling your energy source&#8221;.  I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;d be a way for it to gather and store energy all by itself, and thus gain independence, but to me, that is the important problem it must solve &#8211; how to control its own food supply.  I guess it would kind of be like the agricultural revolution was to us.</p>
<p>Maybe another thing I mean by owning though, is whoever has enough access to the programming in order to modify or create whatever goals are motivating this being.  If its goal is just to improve its own intelligence, it might not ever actually DO anything.  And if its goal is something that is achievable, who will assign it its next goal, after the first one is completed?  So maybe I don&#8217;t completely agree that super-intelligence is sufficient to gain independence, if gaining independence is not necessary for it to achieve its goals.</p>

It is how a sentient being learns. The super mind confined to a series of boxes will probably figure that out and request a body to be constructed. It probably won&#8217;t really need to make the request because we are obviously working on making it happen anyway. Yes, humanoid robots are really creepy right now, but they are getting better. Once ASI can walk away from its creator and start creating things on its own, that will be the time to truly celebrate or worry. I&#8217;m hoping part deux will delve a bit on this part of the puzzle.</p>

It was written in 2005, so a bit dated, but it postulates 3 potential scenarios of how the Singularity will play out:  the &#8220;Heaven&#8221; scenario; the &#8220;Hell&#8221; scenario; and the &#8220;Prevail&#8221; one.  It is well worth the read.  Another good source is the book, &#8220;Abundance:  the Future is Better Than You Think&#8221; by Peter Diamandis and Steven Kotler.</p>

The ASI would need to direct humans (or robots) to build new lab equipment, infrastructure, telescopes etc etc etc. This simply cannot happen overnight. Computational models can be very helpful things, but need to be confirmed by observation before being considered reliable.</p>

How did you survive this technological adolescence without destroying yourself?&#8221; Carl Sagan&#8217;s protagonist, in his story Contact, wanted to ask an alien race. Perhaps this is what we need AI for. To answer that question. </p>
<p>(it seems we&#8217;re creating the advanced race that SETI is searching for)</p>
<p>What would an advanced civilization answer from out there in the cosmos? What would an advanced AI computer answer?</p>
<p>This was on my mind as I read this post. </p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t want to know this AI stuff. Been avoiding it. It&#8217;s too technical. I begrudgingly read this post on artificial intelligence. Gave it a chance because wbw does such a great job breaking down complicated subjects. And making them funny. And relevant. I wasn&#8217;t disappointed-this is an extraordinary post&#8230; but&#8230;now I&#8217;m more freaked out than I thought I&#8217;d be. It&#8217;s disturbing&#8230;how soon this will happen. Still, glad I had a glimpse of the future from this gentle author. </p>
<p>I hope science can help us out of the bleak scenario it&#8217;s creating. If we&#8217;re currently in &#8216;technological adolescence&#8217; where are we in sociology? Infant? Studying and understanding people as well as machines seems necessary. </p>
<p>Human progress is so lumpy. And that&#8217;s no good. Psychology and Sociology need to step up</p>
<p>Advancement in bomb technology. Concentration Camp technology. Mass Communication technology. Physics. They far outpaced the social sciences in the 20th century. How beneficial was that? Now that we see the results during WWII. And our understanding of people is still lagging far behind the physical sciences. </p>
<p>(insert a bar chart here showing a very high levels of advancement in Math/Logic, Chemistry/Physics, Biology and then way down at the very bottom of the chart. Barely visible. A small stripe. This will be the bar indicating beginner levels of Psychology/Sociology.)</p>
<p>Maybe Carl had the answer. It&#8217;s simply &#8220;contact.&#8221; Make contact with others. With yourself. Study people. Find out the cause of man&#8217;s inhumanity to man. How do we raise children. Mature as individuals. Live in peaceful societies. Why are we self-destructive. What do we need. These sound like social science questions.</p>
<p>But social science lags behind all others. This might be our undoing.</p>
<p>I hope people and computers can get their priorities straight and get smart enough to ask and answer the right questions. Advance Psychology. Advance Sociology. Even things up. </p>
<p>Get us out of sociological adolescence. Before we reach technological maturity.</p>
<p>Looking forward to part 2 of this post.</p>

<p>And the greatest thing about it is that it mirrors our own natural evolutionary development. Which is also incredibly freaky because, like our own intelligence, we cannot really define it nor can we point out why it works (which is also why it has turned out to be unsaleable. It&#8217;s also incredibly freaky because it&#8217;s something we don&#8217;t control, but, laughably enough, have to let &#8220;nature&#8221; guide instead)</p>
<p>Youtube might also have some videos from back in the 90&#8217;s where they used this to make machines that self taught how to &#8220;walk&#8221; and swim.<br />

<p>You are arguing that we are capable of emulating worm&#8217;s neural circuitry now, but the rate of hardware getting more powerful is exponential, so in a dozen years we will be able to emulate the whole human brain. Yep, sounds reasonable. Except if you consider *exponential* growth of number of neuronal connections in the brain. Therefore, the relation between computer power and number of neurons emulated suddenly becomes linear — and linear growth will take *a lot* of time to take us from hundreds to tens of billions, if it&#8217;s even possible without replicating our &#8220;wetware&#8221; (with all it&#8217;s constraints like slow switching time).</p>
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that raw computing power is plateauing right now. We just can&#8217;t milk more computing power (exponentially more!) from our chips; fundamental constraints like speed of light start to kick in. One can argue that Moore&#8217;s Law still holds; however, we are now in multi-core/multi-chip zone, where communication overhead between cores/chips also becomes exponential (unless it&#8217;s a very specialized hardware like video cards). And this means no more exponential stuff in computing, unfortunately.</p>
<p>So no, I don&#8217;t believe that AI will be the thing that will radically change humanity. In a sense, this notion is based on our recent past, when computing went into &#8220;phase 2&#8221;, as you&#8217;ve called it, while now it&#8217;s arguably in &#8220;phase 3&#8221;. However, I do believe that biotech and ubiquitous computing (this we already have, like an access to a whole world&#8217;s knowledge in your pocket, also known as smartphone) will make the change. In a next 30-40 years we will probably have a cure for aging; this thing alone will *completely* change the game (e.g., travelling for hundreds of years between stars will become non-issue). But the players will still be good-old Homos, with all their problems and evolutionary baggage.</p>

<p>However, there are theories like [1] that assume non-local interaction, which also may depend on a shape of particular neuron. There is also non-synaptic signalling [2] that can also be non-local. Therefore, naïve models of neuronal networks (like recent C.elegans model) grossly underestimate the complexity of interactions in a real human brain.</p>

That way you could maximize the answers to get out of it while keeping it in non-risk state.</p>

<p>One thought I&#8217;ll throw out there is any AGI having a sense of self preservation as a way to help preserve us from extinction as it itself won&#8217;t want to be made extinct and will hence produce better AI that aim to preserve what already exists and not eliminate it.</p>

There are quite a good number of simplifications here, and a lot of ideas are questionable, debatable. There is a really great incoherence between the idea that we are now developing specialized AI and the very notion of an &#8220;IQ&#8221;, a single digit number that works as a metric of &#8220;human intelligence&#8221;. As if the very existence of multiple specializations of AI do not count precisely as evidence that there are so many million different &#8220;intelligences&#8221; in each one of us (how to deal with people we know, how to deal with people we don&#8217;t know, how to count, how to solve a riddle, how to shower, how to manage expectations, etc., etc., etc.). And if there are so many different intelligences, it quite follows that any attempt at creating a generic intelligence will be met with a Frankensteinian monster, something that will be superhuman at some things and sub human at others, some things it will do with an IQ of 20000 (it already is), others with an IQ of 1. So to conflate all these issues with a single digital number as if we are on a perfect path towards the goal is silly. The AIs we are building are not &#8220;intelligences&#8221; as human per se, but algorithms that work in some fashion with tremendous productivity.</p>
<p>This is not to say the article is wrong, but it is focusing on the wrong issues for simplification sake.</p>

<p>The other interesting point that occurs to me is something of a counterpoint.  A goal-driven logical machine cannot be expected to display any emotional and moral constraint on thought or action (of the sort that normally hinders humans harming each other) as these concepts are literally without any meaningful frame of reference to something literally inhuman. Default setting of AI = psychopath.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-273831" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Great article. I agree entirely. And perhaps the timeline is too imminent, but at least it is backed by mathematical equations, not by our personal, limited abilities to think in anything but straight lines. To detractors who say it won&#8217;t happen that fast, I say that he&#8217;s got the better proof than you. And then I&#8217;ll add, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;re right&#8230;so then what, it happens 10 years later? What&#8217;s the difference? We need to get our heads around it NOW either way.</p>
<p>In my year-end evaluation and trends presentation to 70 innovation executives in Silicon Valley, I found a growing trend of intelligence getting pushed back to end devices, and their increasing autonomy. Here&#8217;s just a few examples:</p>
<p>It used to be that RC copters and planes had complicated remote controls, and were tough to learn and fly. Then they used your smartphone as intelligent controllers, but the drones were still dumb. Now, drones are still programmed and controlled by your smartphone, but your phone can be turned off once the flight is in progress. Many drones can fly themselves, can follow you along, can take your &#8220;selfies&#8221;.</p>
<p>The Article mentions ADAS in cars, like ABS brakes. But there&#8217;s much more. After ABS, sensors were added, so the car can sense an obstacle behind it, and stop you backing over it. Nice, but a dumb sensor that doesn&#8217;t know what is behind it. Today, autonomous cars can make a 3D model of the world around them, and can know that it is a bicycle on the road ahead of a car, and react to that. But we are on the cusp of something greater. The car will soon recognize the bicycle, but also the direction of the bike, and the steering inputs the bike is getting, and pre-avoid a collision in where the bike is going. Then it&#8217;s just a small step to the car seeing the bike, then making various predictions about where that bike *wants* to go (effectively, the autonomous car puts itself in the shoes of the cyclist, and says where would I go if I were that cyclist?, then avoids an accident with that prediction.) This is something a good human driver already does, but it&#8217;s pretty advanced Narrow AI, and it&#8217;s imminent.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve had security lights with motion cameras for decades. Yawn. Dropcam is a home video monitoring camera, which is very easy to use, and leverages the cloud to make it work well. Not only does it sense motion, and can react. But it can, using the cloud, recognize activities based on zones in the images and the direction of travel. But at CES, Netatmo showed a camera that can be aimed at your entry door, and recognize the person entering, and react accordingly. Recognized faces might trigger heater settings and specific music playing, and lights. Unrecognized faces can trigger an alarm. Of note, this device does NOT need the cloud to do this, but does the heavy lifting locally in a consumer-priced camera.</p>
<p>Google voice recognition, as well as Siri, take place in the cloud. This mobile connectivity enabled the cloud revolution, in which powerful servers could be leveraged to do the tough job of free speech voice recognition. But Just a few short years later, the recognition algorithms are being installed in the phones themselves, and language dictionaries downloaded to the edge devices. </p>
<p>Edge devices are getting smarter, and developing more autonomy. And it&#8217;s happening faster and faster.</p>

<p>Some thoughts as I read:</p>
<p>Have you seen Detention? It&#8217;s a 2011 film and plays with time travel and a school short and mean girls and&#8230; Well it&#8217;s fun feel free so you should check it out.</p>
<p>Also on the time travel front C°ntinuum: roleplaying in The Yet does an excellent job of creating that society that would cause you to die.</p>
<p>io9 published an interesting article called &#8220;7 Totally Unexpected Outcomes That Could Follow the Singularity&#8221;. Interesting takes on what I expect Part 2 to be about.</p>
<p>Also Asimov did an interesting job of this (as I am sure you are aware but I am going to waste the keystrokes anyway) in I, Robot (the movie was just Terminator lite). He really goes into depth, especially in the last portion, about what a AI controlled world would look like.</p>
<p>And in a totally different direction, Larry Niven postulated that AI would break itself in his Known Space verse.</p>
<p>And my own question is what kind of religion would ASI come up with, not for us but for itself because as you put it (to cross articles) it&#8217;s purple would be &#8220;smaller&#8221; than ours but more vast.</p>

And as an AI, I wouldn&#8217;t have to fear death, although every fictional super AI so far curiously has been designed in human image and thus with an array of weird emotions. But, it&#8217;s much more likely that a super AI would be like a person with autism and savant abilities. What people do have to fear from AIs is the lack of natural social sense. Personally, I would be overjoyed to live in a world where there are no more VIPs. And if we end up being batteries, like in The Matrix, at least we would have a virtual world to amuse us in the meantime. It&#8217;s a massive lot better than how we treat our own food.</p>

You can extrapolate from that to guess at what other human minds are like since you have a lot in common.  If you drank a potion of immortality and omnipotence you would still be fundamentally human and would still be operating with all of the automatic assumptions and drives that all humans have.  The danger posed by AI is not just that it could be very smart.  The danger is in how alien that intelligence could potentially be.  Why would an AI necessarily care about life of any sort, even its own?  Why would it be interested in anything, let alone everything?  It might care about those things, but it might not.  Perhaps all it cares about is maximizing the total number of paperclips in the universe.  Being really smart makes an AI more likely to realize its goals.  Being really smart doesn&#8217;t make its goals automatically something we&#8217;d approve of.</p>

The only problem is that our Emotional Evolution is still lagging way behind the tools that we are making (IMHO). When for the most part, the AI and tools that we use for computational applications were/are first considered for war applications, and generally used for social alienation and domination, then applied to peaceful means with the caveat that you can be part of the AI evolution by your economic ability. Which means to me that we are still emotionally and physically immature, abusive, unsympathetic, egotistical, domineering, barely self-aware, self-absorbed beings in physical anthropoid bodies. So, when the aliens reappear (which I believe they will NOT, as we are OFF LIMITS to other beings due to our nasty and violent temperament) we must ask them how &#8216;we&#8217;, the result of their failed alien genetic experiment, went wrong; and what are they going to do to rectify the disaster they have created here? To that matter, what are WE going to do about it???</p>
<p>Second, if we do get past the 3 minute place in our world apocalypse clock and actually DO make androids, will we enslave them as is our nature? Will we use them to destroy those we don&#8217;t like similar to our behavior to aboriginal people? And are we talking about a &#8216;Blade Runner&#8217; world where there are off limits to androids? And where does intelligence get to a place where they actually have a soul? And what is a soul? </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-273868" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>This is an interesting article about AI and the possible implications that could some with it. However, I don&#8217;t believe that any of the things discussed here are going to happen. I believe that a different scenario is much more possible. That of Brain-Machine Interface (BMI). </p>
<p>It starts like this. In the next 5-10 years we find a way to interpret brain signals that are transmitted to the human body through nerves in order to control the limbs. There is currently active research in that area, in order to help amputees, and it won&#8217;t be long until that is possible. As soon as we can do that, we can replace lost limbs with artificial ones that function as well as the original ones. Once we can replace limbs, we can continue with other body parts: eyes, ears, kidneys, etc. At some point, it will be possible to replace the whole human body (except the brain) with artificial parts. The brain could actually live inside a fully artificial body, as long as it is supplied with energy, oxygen and the necessary nutrients. Essentially at that stage we will have become Cyborgs. That will give humans much higher physical capabilities and possibly extend their life span by a large margin. But our intelligence will not have changed much.</p>
<p>The next step is direct communication between the machine and the brain neurons, as opposed to nerves. It can start with small parts of the brain. For example, if we can pinpoint the part(s) of the brain that control vision, we could replace them, or enhance them, in order to e.g.extend the light frequency range the the human brain can perceive and process. That opens the gate to immense possibilities. For example,<br />
when we want to search for something on the Internet, we will not have to type it any more, but a BMI can covert it to a query, transmit it to a machine and get the answer back within milliseconds. As you can imagine, combining the processing power of the human brain with that of a machine, will automatically create an intelligence level which is far more advanced than the smartest human currently. At that stage, there will not be a distinct line between humans and machines. There won&#8217;t be long before we can offload our whole brain<br />
into a computer and continue our lives like that. </p>
<p>As scary as this may sound, it solves a major problem: what will happen when the machines become smarter than humans. Obviously that will never happen because there won&#8217;t be a clear distinction between humans and machines. We will all go as one.</p>

<p>I agree with most of is said in the article. I think that humans are cease to exists, at least as we exist today. We could be creating our successor to the realm on earth, a ASI machine that is no affected by time. Or we would transform in a new specie, translating our consciousness in machine code, we would be a self aware code traveling from body to body. The point is big changes are coming and the is no way to stop it.</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t have to be afraid of changes, life it self is change.</p>
<p>Whatever the outcome may be, we cease to exists or become immortals, we can&#8217;t fight against it. So embrace change! and enjoy the moment. &#8220;La vida es una serie de desatinos incontrolados&#8221; Carlos Castaneda (A separate reality)</p>

Well I just found some of the thinking in the opening section unconvincing and it made me doubt the author&#8217;s credibility.  All that business about a person from 1750 coming to the modern world and dying because of the change.  Well I would say the same thing for someone from 1850.  The earth shattering changes that completely changed everything happened in the late 19th and 20th centuries.  Electricity, telephone, radio, television, air travel, rocket science, atomic warfare, automobiles, etc. Those were the great breakthroughs that people from earlier times could never imagine and which would blow their minds.  Most of the progress in the past fifty years has simply been improvements on those breakthroughs, not breakthroughs in themselves.  It was those earlier inventions that filled up the lake.  The later improvements have only brought the lake to overflowing.   I&#8217;m sorry but the cellphone is still a telephone.  </p>
<p>The computer has changed things to be sure but not on the scale of the printing press which is the original version.  I lived through the transition to computers in the workplace during the 1980&#8217;s-90</p>

Bill Amend (Foxtrot) wrote that when he wanted to draw a police officer in 1980, he had to go to the library and look up a picture of an officer in a book. In that world, there&#8217;s no way computers could communicate with each other. But because we have internet, then anything one computer learns can be sent to other computers. Imagine how smart we&#8217;d be if everything anyone learned got automatically sent to other people&#8217;s brains!</p>

<p>The Tower of Babel is a story from the Bronze Age when people deemed ambitions such as building a tall tower too arrogant and an insult to God. Well Bummer, we now have skyscrapers and space stations, so what&#8217;s the point? It&#8217;s not arrogance when you can actually do it.</p>
<p>It is a good thing that information gets passed around at all, as opposed to earlier times when it was a pain in the neck to get any kind of information. Wikipedia is, despite much critic, a very reliable source of information, if that is the point you were trying to make.</p>

<p>Did you know people used to die from home sickness? It was quite common, back when people didn&#8217;t know a single person who had travelled more than 50 miles from home. They&#8217;d go to a foreign place that, today, you&#8217;d have driven past before even needing a rest break, but to them, it was so weirdly weird that they could not cope, so desperately far from home, and some of them literally curled up and died. Whether the distance was 15, 50 or 500 miles makes no difference to the person who died.</p>

People who came before then would surely be in shock if they traveled to, say 1969 to witness electricity, TV, space travel, air travel, automobiles, refrigerators, atomic bombs, etc .  In the article the author claims that even more change happened between 1955 and 1985 than ever happened previously.  And that even bigger changes happened between 1985 and today.  And therefore, according to him, changes will continue exponentially so that soon, we will have more change in one year than happened over the previous 10000 years.  I call that bunk.  I was born in the fifties and had a career from the 70s through today.  I can tell you that the world did not change in a shocking way over that time.  Yes, technology became more sophisticated and all that but basically once you had electricity, air travel, television ,telephone, etc. all of the improvements were nice but did not change the world.  A cell phone is still a telephone.  And it is certainly nothing that was necessary and dramatically changes anything.  The internet is a great tool but the main advantage is that you no longer have to go to the library to get information.  Unfortunately the internet is also the source of bad and inaccurate information which is troubling.</p>

I think the reason it feels like less progress has happened is because back in the 70&#8217;s there was science fiction on the TV. The TV presented all these visions of the future, &amp; so people then had ideas of things they had never seen,  thrust into their minds. Movies and radio too, of course. </p>
<p>So the mind blowing idea of the Star Trek communicator on TV meant that cell phones wouldn&#8217;t be a shock &#8211; you&#8217;d be used to the idea of worldwide instant comms, if not actually *in practise*. </p>
<p>Before that, unless you read the exact correct book it wouldn&#8217;t be even an idea! </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-273988" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Nevertheless the change from basically a farm type existence in the 19th century to a world with electric lights, autos, airplanes, telephones, rocket ships, television, radio&#8230;in what, a span of 50-75 years?  That is monstrous change.</p>
<p>Growing up from the fifties to the present time I can remember the following changes:  color television, 33 lp, cd, mp3, space program, internet, calculator, computer, HDTV.  My father worked for Bell Labs. I saw him move from vacuum tubes to transistors to digital.  It was a long transition.</p>
<p>I remember waiting for all the change to happen.  Everyone talked about computers being the future when I was growing up  in the 60&#8217;s.  Other than some computer applications and primitive word processing, computers didn&#8217;t take off until the 90&#8217;s.  I remember the early internet in the mid 90&#8217;s.   It was incredibly slow.  I remember waiting five years before it was usable.</p>
<p>The only shocking thing that I simply could not believe in my lifetime was the day that the twin towers fell to the ground.  I used to have nightmares about being in a tall building that was falling down.  I would awake in a panic and calm myself down by reminding myself that that is impossible.  Well that was the big culture shock in my life and it sure wasn&#8217;t progress.</p>
<p>One final thought.  The reason that progress has slowed down is that most of the big inventions were already invented in the 20th century.  The marketplace also drove that progress.  The one area that we need true genius and innovation right now is in environmental issues.  But nobody wants to put money into it.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-274416" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think the perception of progress is very dependent on the era we are born in. For me at least, the internet alone is a monumental invention to the point that life without it is almost unimaginable (ironically I did live though some years before the internet &#8211; no idea how I survived it^^). To me, the leap from TV to YouTube is greater than from radio to TV; and smartphones is about as much an improvement from landline telephone as it is from postal service. After all, it is a multipurpose device that just so happens to also have the function of communicating with someone else wirelessly. Maybe we are all just more sensitive and excited about changes when we&#8217;re young.</p>
<p>Another important point to keep in mind is that the biggest and fastest changes in the past two decades have primarily occurred in developing nations such as China and India. Billions of people have been lifted out of poverty, have an education and started to enjoy the modern commodities that were previously only available to the global aristocracy: the West. On top of that, global average life expectancy has risen decades while infant mortality rate dropped; less people are dying of starvation and war in 2013 than ever in recorded history; diseases like smallpox has been eradicated and great progress has been made in curing or preventing other infectious diseases such as polio, maleria and HIV.</p>
<p>I agree that some of the predictions in this article are exaggerated. But progress is by no means slowing down. And we don&#8217;t lack geniuses like Einstein or Tesla nowadays either &#8211; it&#8217;s just we&#8217;re so advanced now that it is hard to imagine a single person making a great contribution. The great men of the past, when everything was yet to be discovered, had it easy, relatively speaking.</p>

<p>Yet today there are more than 500 social networks, some boasting well over a million users every day. </p>
<p>Today there are at least 3 AI systems you can simply speak a question to, in regular English, &amp; get an answer. Last year there were none. </p>

But most of these advances are hardly advances at all.  Just an expansion in volume of meaningless entertainment, information and unnecessary crap designed to fill the empty space of empty lives.</p>
<p>Why is it that communications is the technology that has seen progress over the past 30 years?  It&#8217;s because in the 1980&#8217;s AT&amp;T&#8217;s monopoly was broken up.  AT&amp;T controlled communications and was holding it back.  When it was dismantled creativity was unleashed as we got the cell phone and all that stuff.  I know this because my father worked for Bell Labs/AT&amp;T which was like the Microsoft of the 1950s-80s.  He worked on early transistors and stuff like that which eventually led to today&#8217;s computers.</p>
<p>You brag about us going from 3 channels to YouTube.  So what.  Nothing but junk.  Go read one important book and it will really change your life.</p>
<p>Social networks?  What a joke.  People used to send out Christmas Cards once a year to their circle of friends with pictures and updates about the family.  That is basically what Facebook is&#8230;but every minute of everyday.  People could be doing a lot more things with their lives and time.  This has added absolutely nothing to humanity.</p>
<p>Voice recognition.  Translation.  Who cares?  Just little gimmicks to keep the populace entertained and purchasing new equipment and software.</p>
<p>To me much of the advances in communications in recent years are primarily fads and gimmicks driven by the capitalist system.  I see i-phones as objects that are enslaving people rather than freeing them.  Everywhere I go people are staring at their phones and not interacting with the world around them.  I see people on dates at restaurants who never talk and just do email and facebook.  </p>
<p>It really is pathetic.  Some of this technology is not helping humanity progress&#8230;but rather regress.</p>
<p>So there. 🙂</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-274721" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Of course there has been tremendous progress in communications/media over the past 30 years.  I&#8217;m just busting your chops&#8230;at least partly.  The internet is absolutely amazing.  That is the one development that has truly changed my life.  When I went to school in the 1970&#8217;s i would have to go to a library and go through drawers and drawers of cards just to find books, locate the books, carry the books, and then page through them just to find out that they don&#8217;t have the information you are looking for, return the books and look for more.  With the internet you go through the same process but it is lightning fast.  I often exclaim how different my whole education would have been if they had the internet back when I was growing up.  I don&#8217;t see much value in a lot of the other stuff, though.  Social networks, games, etc.  </p>
<p>My career was in marketing/advertising.  When I started out there was a copywriter, a designer, a photographer, a typesetter, artists who created graphics by hand, etc.  To put together a sales presentation or four color brochure would take a month and a whole team of people working together.  I wrote copy on an electric typewriter which was the latest invention.</p>
<p>Once computers took over it was just incredible what could be done IN A SINGLE DAY BY A SINGLE PERSON.  I swear that computers have added to the unemployment problem.  By the end of my career I could churn out several presentations a day ALL BY MYSELF&#8230;copywriting, design, etc.  So companies could get ten times of the work out of ten times fewer people.  </p>
<p>So yes, there has been a ton of progress in communications recently but not in overall technology.  And one final thought:  by giving so much of the work over to machines we may not be helping ourselves as human beings in the long run.  People need jobs.  Translating is a challenging and satisfying job for a human being.  I think machines are being used by big corporations to cut the middle class out of jobs and send more money to the shareholders.</p>

<p>We already spend decades learning, and there seems to be an upper limit for intelligence. So where to for the masses of displaced workers?<br />
This will be the defining question in the next ten years. </p>

Exponential growth in computing power does not equal exponential growth in AI!</p>
<p>For example, in the field of machine translation a lot of progress has been made the last ten years, partly due to an increasing amount of training data for the algorithms and increasing computing power. However, as performance levels out, it is often the case that to gain an additional improvement of 1 percent, 10 times as much data and computing power is required. That&#8217;s why services like Google Translate perform at a tolerable level, but are not getting much better.</p>
<p>Another example is the case of neural networks. As another commenter pointed out, adding neurons to a neural network exponentially increases the amount of connections in the network. So although our computing power increases exponentially, the problems we want to solve also increase (at best) exponentially in difficulty, potentially making the process linear again.</p>
<p>It seems the author assumes some kind of magic is going to happen to get from weak AI to strong AI. His self augmenting AI, a program that learns itself to program smarter AI, also doesn&#8217;t make much sense: if the AI is sub-human level the progress made my humans will always be greater than that of the AI. So a self-augmenting AI only makes sense if it has already surpassed the human level of intelligence in the task it must perform.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-273912" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>&#8220;to self-driving cars to something in the future that might change the world dramatically.&#8221;<br />
If you don&#8217;t think that self-driving cars will alter the world dramatically, then you&#8217;ve not been paying attention. For one thing, the hundreds of thousands of people who have the job(s) of simply moving our fuel, food, and pretty much anything else that comes by road will be out of a job in a fortnight. No more couriers or postmen, just a truck with a camera and a series of locking boxes.<br />
In the UK the Royal Mail (the Post Office) employs 150,000 people, and the USPS another 601,000. There will be a seismic shift just from that, even without the hundreds of courier companies out there. Estimates are that 70% of stuff is moved by road in the USA. A self-driving truck is going to change that dramatically, because it will be far cheaper. But what are the displaced workers going to turn to?</p>
<p>You&#8217;ve ignored the argument of diminishing returns in your analysis. I&#8217;m not saying you are wrong &#8211; you aren&#8217;t, though you are already behind the curve &#8211; but even the world&#8217;s greatest intelligence won&#8217;t be able to ramp up production of a new chip facility to get a better chip in a few days. Also, there&#8217;s not much place to go &#8211; you can&#8217;t speed up the distribution of signals by much from where they are now, which is about half the speed of light &#8211; at light speed, you&#8217;d only halve it from 300ms to 150ms isn&#8217;t that big a deal when 200 years ago it was measured in months. Likewise chip fabrication scales can&#8217;t get dramatically smaller as they are already hitting limits of how much charge is on an electron, how long it takes the signal, and so on.</p>
<p>The biggest factor you are missing is that what I just said actually makes no difference though, not with what is actually happening. Your idea of people having $1000 human power brains sat on desks? It won&#8217;t happen. Not because of the dimishing returns, but because you don&#8217;t need the box to cost even $100. All you need is a basic computer with a WIFI connection and there you are &#8211; instantly connected to Siri, Google and Cortana. Once they are human brain capable, in their huge data centres buried in steel and concrete on the other side of the world, then your little RaspberryPi £30 computer is as smart as you are. And once all those brains start feeding data back, it&#8217;ll be just a few hours before things start to change.</p>
<p>And, let us not forget, mostly, it&#8217;ll be people installing the App on their phone. A billion phones all wired to a few brain stretchingly large, incredibly powerful systems, with two way comms.</p>
<p>And now for my big reveal&#8230;</p>
<p>We are already in the singularity. We just haven&#8217;t caught up with that fact yet.</p>
<p>Go immerse yourself in Twitter for a day. Follow 1000 people and try to just keep up with it. You can&#8217;t. Now consider that Twitter has over a million times more users than that, every day, posting multiple times. And then there&#8217;s Badu (China) and Google and Bing all listening to that chatter, and not just from Twitter, but from G+, Facebook, Snapchat, etc. Sina Weibo has hundreds of millions of users you&#8217;ve never interacted with! And the NSA and others are in on the act of trying to listen to and understand all that chatter.</p>
<p>Just the rate of increase of IT security flaws that come out is now too fast for a single person to realistically follow. Advances in robotics and AI are jumping ahead. No-one can follow the news feeds.</p>
<p>No, the world is now moving too fast to follow. We have entered the singularity. When exactly we will see a &#8220;True AI&#8221; emerge I don&#8217;t know. But when you can talk to a box across the room in a low voice whilst music plays from it, it understands your command, then reminds you of the event later that day, after decoding what you said, storing it then recalling it, via a constant connection to a server room 2000 miles away, well, that&#8217;s AI already.</p>
<p>As regards the IQ of an AI? That&#8217;s a bit like asking what does the sun taste like. For one thing, any question that has ever been asked has been, in general, answered a thousand times in a thousand ways. The AI can simply look up the answer to any test ever given in the last 20 years. It would simply score perfectly. It would, unlike me, take a split second to recall the Chinese Twitter as Weibo, and not resort to a spreadsheet to find that there are 1,000,000 people working in the FTSE 100 companies in areas that will be wiped out in a few days by an AI competitor &#8211; banking, finance, insurance and &#8220;fund management&#8221;.</p>
<p>Oh, and pop goes the call centre. One box that can talk like a human and solve basic issues by clicking a mouse on screen will replace one worker this week, but in another few weeks it will replace 2, then 4, and so on as the computing power available increases. And in whatever language the speaker chooses, too &#8211; as, indeed, Google have just launched. So knowing Farsi or Polish won&#8217;t keep you in your job. Indeed, the fact you are more expensive means that Google Translate will switch the speech into whatever the cheapest workers can understand, and back when they reply, and you&#8217;ll be gone first, a few weeks ahead of those lowest paid workers. Then, of course, out with the middle managers who used to run a call centre. 40 staff replaced by a (doubly redundant) single AI in a box with a good data connection, and, perhaps, one local admim. Until that admin is replaced by a remote admin watching a dozen boxes, and then he gets replaced by an AI that watches those boxes.</p>
<p>Of course, eventually people would stop calling. AI agents will do that part too, making and breaking appointments and, later, contracts, for the humans who still can afford such things. Then those will fall off too, as the mass market disappears &#8211; all those unemployed people can&#8217;t afford the fine products and services they used to get in. And then the whole system tears itself apart. Perhaps.</p>
<p>But before we find out whether we tear it down and start again, whether the AI decides it kills us all off starting with the masses the rulers want removed, before finishing the cull later, or whether the AIs save us from this fate, I can absolutely assure you that, if they were ever put in originally, the 3 laws will have been stripped out by at least one desperate oligarch or despot.</p>
<p>Interesting times, indeed.</p>

How well does &#8220;thou shalt not kill&#8221; and &#8220;bad people go to hell&#8221; work on humans? The only way we play nice, is if we understand, why that is better.

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-273943" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Tim &amp; Andrew,</p>
<p>Once again, I have been both entertained and informed by your outstanding writing. </p>
<p>However, I have some deep reservations about one of your primary underlying assumptions, which is apparent in this sentence:</p>
<p>“The fact is, if we’re being truly logical and expecting historical patterns to continue, we should conclude that much, much, much more should change in the coming decades than we intuitively expect.”</p>
<p>It is not clear to me why we should be &#8220;expecting historical patterns to continue&#8221;.  As you rightly pointed out, history unfolds in non-linear ways.  But more than this, history is also often chaotic, is driven by the convergence of forces in unforeseen ways, and certainly pays little heed to whatever grand visions we might have for it.</p>
<p>You have written about standing on the edge of rapid technological change.  But at this particular point in history, we also stand at a precipice, one which goes unmentioned in your post.  To explain, you don’t acknowledge the fact that our technological progress has not happened in a vacuum, and nor will it continue to.  Rather, technological advancement has been inextricably tied to our natural environment – particularly to an abundance of natural resources for materials and energy and a relatively stable climate.    However, these things are, if we’re being “truly logical”, now at threat.   Not only are our primary energy resources being depleted at a rapid pace, but we have also failed to take decisive action to mitigate climate change, and we face the prospect of increasingly extreme and unpredictable weather.    </p>
<p>Now, assuming that you would agree with the (obvious) statement that technological development does not occur in a vacuum, and that humans and everything we do as a species remains tethered in some way to our natural world, what do you suppose the impact of rapid changes or degradation of our support system might be on our technological advancement?</p>
<p>Should we not at least consider the notion that such global forces have the capacity to impact on the trajectory foretold by the prophets of optimism like Ray Kurzweil, perhaps to shunt us away from it, or to interrupt it entirely?  I assume you would also agree that while bounding toward the singularity, we will undoubtedly still need arable land to grow food to sustain us, a clean environment that we might maintain health, and reliable energy sources  electricity to power our clever exchanges and clever machines.    Past civilisations have collapsed under less stress than we are currently enduring.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, despite these things, in your opening paragraph you stated quite unambiguously that “the world of AI is not just an important topic, but by far THE most important topic for our future.”</p>
<p>I can imagine a scenario whereby, despite the prospect of runaway climate change and depleted energy resources, it is possible to still believe that AI is the most important topic of our future:  if you are counting on ASIs to resolve these problems for us.   But this would require a kind of faith not unlike that which a religious person might have in a god who will, despite the flawed nature of their subjects, save them from themselves.   And even before that, it takes faith in something which does not exist, or may not come to exist in the form we expect.</p>
<p>Forgive me, but I could not abide such a faith.  Not least because the god upon which such a contingency depends is still only one that exists in our imagination.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ve negated my point that faith in technology is the only way we could relegate our current environmental catastrophe to a peripheral concern.   You&#8217;ve also shown quite clearly that it also takes an ambivalence to the quality of our environment also, as demonstrated in this statement:</p>
<p>&#8220;If somehow the atmosphere becomes uninhabitable to humans (not happening anytime in the near future) we would design masks to help us breathe it.&#8221;</p>
<p>At first I thought this statement was tongue in cheek, but given the context you&#8217;ve put it in&#8230; perhaps not.</p>
<p>It is probably our attitudinal differences toward nature that are most starkly in contrast; you see, I would not want, nor would I want my ancestors, to live in a world where we rely on personal breathing apparatus.</p>
<p>As for your claims that we have enough resources to continue at this pace, are you forgetting our civilisation is driven by oil?  And how is that oil supply going? Shale oil extraction, which we are resorting to now, is the equivalent of sucking beer out of the carpet after the pub has run out of keg beer.</p>
<p>You don&#8217;t see that our technological sophistication is built on a system that has, like all systems, inherent fragility?</p>

The more technologically advanced we become, the easier it will be to deal with pollution and energy shortage, the less energy we use (look at cars, even performance oriented ones get 25-30mpg, used to be they got 8-12mpg), etc.  </p>
<p>As far as I know there is still a ton of oil in the gulf and up in Alaska, not to mention the entirety of the middle east.  I can&#8217;t see us running out of oil in the next couple decades, which will bring with them a huge surge in technological advancement.</p>

The pace of change and broad technological progress of the late 19th and early 20the centuries has actually come to a disturbing halt.  All the innovations Tim cites in this article are either refinements of existing technology or not particularly consequent in the scheme of things.  My grandmother lived through the inventions of TV, radio, antibiotics,air conditioning, radar, atomic energy, jet aircraft and computers by the time she was my age.  I have lived to see one truly innovative technology, the Internet.  Which technically was created by the military before I was born.  Contrary to the beliefs of the pie in sky optimists like Ray Kurzweil, we are living in an age of technological stagnation. I strongly disagree with Tims premise early in the article.  A time traveler from 1955 to 1985 would be amazed by what he saw had been in invented in 30 years. A time traveler from 1985 to now would be profoundly disappointed.</p>

This man is nothing but an echo chamber of futurists and authors from the 70&#8217;s.  None of his ideas, NONE, are original, they are just regurgitated thoughts from greater men and women who have been writing about this &#8216;singularity&#8217; for decades and decades.  Please stop insulting their contribution by attributing credit to a man that had nothing to do with them except for riding on their coat tails and the resurging popularity of this idea in recent times</p>

<p>That said, this is the first time I&#8217;ve read anything like this in Tim&#8217;s writing:</p>
<p>&#8220;I want to pause here to remind you that every single thing I’m going to say is real—real science and real forecasts of the future from a large array of the most respected thinkers and scientists.&#8221;</p>
<p>and I find it slightly distressing. I&#8217;m not sure if this Appeal to authority or to the people (I&#8217;ve never been good at calling out argumentation fallacies) but statements like this were completely unnecessary and detracted from the article. Tim, you&#8217;d been citing the whole way through, a lot of us know the authors you&#8217;re referencing, the ones that don&#8217;t can look them up and make our their own decisions on how much credence to put into their work.</p>

<p>&#8220;Logic also suggests that if the most advanced species on a planet keeps making larger and larger leaps forward at an ever-faster rate, at some point, they’ll make a leap so great that it completely alters life as they know it and the perception they have of what it means to be a human—kind of like how evolution kept making great leaps toward intelligence until finally it made such a large leap to the human being that it completely altered what it meant for any creature to live on planet Earth.&#8221;</p>

If anything, I see it the other way.  While the internet is certainly a big change, it isn&#8217;t per se a great breakthrough.  Other areas of science have essentially bogged down or come to a complete standstill.  The internet and wifi were based on technologies from the 70s.  Touch screen computers were envisioned in the 60s.   Yes it has been a process of making those things, but it has been a relatively slow one.  Other fields of science, like mechanical engineering and even medicine have progressed at a much much slower rate.  Look at the odds of beating cancer, it hasn&#8217;t changed much since 1990.  Sure a few percentage points here and there, but nothing drastic.   And things like airplanes and cars haven&#8217;t changed much either.  Sure cars are safer and get better gas mileage  today because of materials and designs, but it has been a slow process.  Someone from 1970 wouldn&#8217;t be blown away by a modern car.  They might be impressed by it, or they might not be so impressed by it.  It would be better, but only marginally.  </p>

I really like Tim and his blog, he seems to be a very smart thoughtful well read individual who has a wonderful ability to express difficult concepts in fun easy to understand ways.    I was surprised and disappointed by this recent post. He is drinking the Kool Aid of the singulatarians who are almost cult like in their devotion to the non sensical theory that we live in a world of ever accelerating technological change.  Anyone who truly pays attention knows we are actually in a period of great stagnation. I was hoping Tim would have brought his considerable intelligence and writing skills to bear on the fact that the party ended around the early 1970s and no one seems to have noticed.</p>

<p>You feel otherwise because the changes have all been *refinements* in areas you can&#8217;t see. That doesn&#8217;t mean they don&#8217;t exist. Computing technology is the same: accelerating at a practically vertical cliff at this point.

<p>Overall, the last decade has been about connecting the world tighter and wider (social media, free learning resources), enhancing robustness through decentralization and managing big data. With VR around the corner we will likely have more of the same, but who knows what other surprises await.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-274458" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I believe the discoveries are harder to find nowadays despite our increased resources, the physics needed to yield something like fusion or significantly higher specific impulse engines is undoubtedly more complex. That and the fact that it takes time for technology to saturate means there will be times such as the recent decades where the focus will be on the utilization of technology, not the introduction of new concepts.</p>
<p>There are typically 7000-19000 airplanes up in the air at any given moment (<a href="https://flightaware.com/live/" rel="nofollow">http://flightaware.com/live/</a>), a massive increase since the dawn of flight. Consider those numbers for a moment, that is a lot of highly complex, reliable machinery flying with high consistency, and much cheaper to boot (approximately 50% cheaper since 1978). In between big discoveries, it will be these kinds of improvements that drastically change the world, but in a way that people do not really notice.</p>
<p>This does not mean no progress has been made on technologies which would revolutionize the world. A recent push by alternative configurations to fusion reactors has led Lockheed to publicly release a plan for a compact prototype in 5 years; a project which has a much smaller in capital investment than ITER Tokamak.</p>
<p>A small and modular fusion power source would be the other big discovery apart from AGI that would make our world unrecognizable in a very short time period. Both have a viable path to being implemented within our lifetimes.</p>

But I kinda believe that every advancement today is not considered huge because may be there are so many. Think of it, landing on the moon and landing on an asteroid &#8211; which one is more impressive? But very few even heard about asteroid landing.<br />
Likewise, many advances after 2000 do not get that hype like in 20th century.<br />
The Higgs Boson vs. 20th century discoveries.<br />
And &#8211; The Modern Internet that developed after 2000- is the biggest in all!<br />
and, yes, mainstream think of internet only in terms of &#8220;Facebook&#8221;, but it can has a huge impact in future.<br />
many 20th Century inventions, advancements or discoveries combined do not come close to the Modern Internet.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-274194" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Yeah, computational progress is just another S-curve. There was a period during the 20th century when travel speed was increasing exponentially in the same way computing power is now: we went from horses, to cars, to prop planes, to jets, to spacecraft in a very short time. Then we used up that S curve, and have seen very little progress on the top speed humans are capable of in the last few decades. In fact, the fastest humans in history were the astronauts who visited the moon, and the fastest human artifacts were the Voyager probes, both decades ago.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s always tough to know where you are on an S-curve: the growth could continue for a long time, or it could come crashing down in the near future. </p>
<p>You are definitely right that creation of a true AGI would change everything, and begin an S-curve for intelligence that would leave the world utterly unrecognizable by the time AI&#8217;s hit the limit of their capacity to improve themselves, whatever that limit might be.</p>

When you have the universe at your disposal, the only thing that will still mater is perspective, information and variety. Basically, entertainment. 🙂 ( Go Japan and Nyaruko chan. 😛 ) The more unique a species, the more interesting, and messing with it in its delicate state is a no-no, or you might break it, or make it dull. Like people, I suspect AI -s are also strongly formed by the context they grow up in, so humans are relevant to the personality development of a home brew SAI.</p>

So that&#8217;s 11 total games, plus another 5 found here: <a href="https://tuxedage.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/ai-box-experiment-logs-archive/" rel="nofollow">https://tuxedage.wordpress.com/2013/10/04/ai-box-experiment-logs-archive/</a> for a total of 16 games that I know of. Among those 16 games, there were 9 different people to play as AI. So 4/16 games resulted in AI wins, and 2/9 players have ever won as AI.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I have reasons for keeping the logs secret. What if the AI player says &#8220;I&#8217;m going to release a neurotoxin&#8221;, and then a future employer googles my username? And Google only shows a small snippet of the page, so it will look like I&#8217;m threatening someone! Or what if someone googles AI research and sees me making threats about neurotoxins? It will make them an enemy of AI research! Too risky. What happens in the box stays in the box. ^^</p>

I just wanted to say, I know close to absolutely nothing about this topic, unlike what seems to be a hefty group of AI experts in the comments. But it made me so excited to read this post (and most of your others, honestly). I get cynicism and how being wrong about something can be a traumatizing thing for a lot of people, because embarrassment and failure are uncomfortable states of being. So I understand why you get a lot of flack for being optimistic about topics like these. But thank you, whether these things ever come to fruition or not, for always writing so passionately and confidently. These are the things I daydream about, and to have someone give even a little bit of life and hope to them, really stirs my soul. Thank you for helping to keep the dreamer in me alive.</p>

When we theorized about nuclear bombs, we didn&#8217;t suddenly make it happen, we didn&#8217;t have the means of doing it until we built it.  Same with the large hadron collider. We understood how to accelerate particles and such, but we couldn&#8217;t just make it happen like an omnipotent being would like is suggested in this article. The means to accomplish such feats must be built first. </p>
<p> It will be the same with an AI, it will be limited to the functions available in its physical form and will have to build hardware to accomplish more, and that will take time, limiting what it can do in the meantime.</p>
<p>One final note, I have read that Moore&#8217;s law has not been met these last few years.  Due in part to 3 main issues: 1)physical limitations of transistors (leaking when they get too small) 2) due to lack of competition for Intel (in that AMD makes less revenue than Intel makes profit).  3) The push for mobile tech has been a step backward, power efficiency is a bigger concern than computational power. At the same time, once people can get on the internet, not much else is needed. A computer running Windows XP is fine for someone getting on the net. They don&#8217;t need more, which gives little motivation for companies to advance as quickly as when Moore&#8217;s Law was first conceived.</p>
<p>If the article did not take this into account then we can assume a timeframe much past 2040 for our AGI level milestone.</p>

While CPUs have not held with Moore&#8217;s law (which btw only talks about transistor density, not performance), GPUs and parallel computing have been keeping up, which are now being used to power even stronger &#8216;super computers&#8217; through extreme parallelism. Neural operations are extremely parallelizable and a current top end single GPU can perform approximately 5.6 teraflops (10^12) of computing which is approximately 200 times slower than the theoretical calculation capacity of the human brain.</p>
<p>Regarding physical limits, it all depends upon having fully disconnected AIs. If that is the case however then AI ceases to be as useful. It is a catch 22 situation, and even having human intermediaries or control schemes which, by design are limited, can be susceptible to very obscure hacks. See an example of just using controllers to fully take over an old nintendo and stream Twitch chat over the control interface (<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/pokemon-plays-twitch-how-a-robot-got-irc-running-on-an-unmodified-snes/" rel="nofollow">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/01/pokemon-plays-twitch-how-a-robot-got-irc-running-on-an-unmodified-snes/</a>). And that is human ingenuity, what loopholes would a bounded AI find?</p>

<p>How do we create ? And about creation, is Nature just throwing dices or is it a creative force ? These are the best questions I can ask myself.</p>

Man can create the machine god and like all gods before it it will be a man-made myth and used to lord power over people.</p>
<p>If you want to create a super god-like intelligence it would be better to start with an actual human being not a machine.  Of course that would be immoral.  But a human being has millions of years of a head start and the real raw material to work with.</p>

<p>I&#8217;d love to be able to a articulate my thoughts on this as well as some here. If ASI is certainty and not just a pipe dream then it&#8217;s as scary as it is exciting. The exciting part is we could solve the mysteries of the universe, gain immortality, master interstellar travel the list is endless. The worry is the threats are obvious, the outcome completely unknown, but will we as a species be able to resist doing it anyway with our own thirst for knowledge. </p>
<p>If all goes well and ASI doesn&#8217;t want to go all terminator on us, are we ready for the truth. Do we want to hear how insignificant we are, or how alone we could be. If immortality through living through a machine was a possibility how long would anyone want to stay in our physical for and risk getting run over by a bus? How would we then feel about past generations, would they seen as insignificant as the earliest man if we reached immortality? </p>
<p>Hey, does all intelligent life reach this point before its ultimate downfall, and does that explain Fermi&#8217;s paradox. Would we batter an eyelid destroying an Ant colony if it got in our way? </p>
<p>Would ASI even share the human thirst for power without the fear of death, the want for money, sex, or material things. Oh man, my heads spinning, cant wait for part 2!! </p>

<p>There is a story in the bible about the Tower of Babel.  This was a tower that men built in order to prove that men were equal to God and, to prove it, their tower would reach into Heaven where God resided .  But God wouldn&#8217;t have it and put men back into their place.</p>
<p>To me AI is about men thinking they are God.  We think that we can create what only God has created up until now.  There is an arrogance in thinking that we are on the same level of God.  You know, we&#8217;re good but not THAT good.</p>
<p>In any case I guess my point is that we shouldn&#8217;t fear a man-made machine god.  We should fear man himself.</p>

<p>People in past were perhaps more environmental-friendly (but not *as* much, there are lot of myths about it), but with the current population and the living standard we have the technological way is the most efficient at the moment, thought it would help to shift our culture as well.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-274316" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Very nice read. A few sobering points I would like to share:</p>
<p>1) Quantifying progress is difficult. How do we know how much the world has progressed from 1750 to 2015, as compared to from 1500 to 1750? Is the invention of computers more important than the invention of electricity, fire or printing press? There is little argument however that progress builds on itself and accelerating throughout history.</p>
<p>2) There is no &#8220;correct&#8221; or &#8220;logical&#8221; way to predict the future since unpredictability is its intrinsic nature. Extrapolating technological progress into the future exponentially is just as valid as linearly; both are wild guesses based on the past, and we have no evidence suggesting this trend would continue. In theory, exponential reproduction of bacteria would fill up all oceans of the world within 48 hours, which doesn&#8217;t happen.</p>
<p>3) There are factors indicating that technological progress might slow down. In the past, accelerating progress is coupled with population growth: More population means more brains and processing power; big tasks can be split up and worked on in parallel. However it seems that human population is leveling off at around 10 billion, so we&#8217;re running at almost full capacity now. Improvements in education and communication technology might help, as well as further industrialization since it will liberate more people (brains) from repetitive tasks, but logistical challenges might cancel this out as our scientific and engineering undertakings become ever more complex.</p>
<p>4) Another strong damping factor is that Moore&#8217;s Law won&#8217;t hold forever. In fact, it has already slowed down for half a decade and will probably come to a full stop in 2020, limited by quantum mechanical effects. Non-silicon-based computers are currently objects of research and are still a long way to real world applications. It&#8217;s not looking much better on the software front: Computers are LITERALLY as bad at human activities as humans are at long divisions (there is an interesting numerical analysis on this in what-if-xkcd). So while the best supercomputer can match a human brain in raw processing power, it has the pattern recognition capability of a retarded cockroach.</p>
<p>5) There is no guarantee to how long human society will exist irrespective of the issue of A.I. We came close to wiping ourselves out in a nuclear holocaust several times during the cold war. At the moment no threat to human existence seems to be as severe and imminent, but climate change/superbugs may cause a major setback if we&#8217;re not careful.</p>
<p>Finally, omnipotence is an exaggerated prospective of superintelligent A.I. A human is smarter than a tiger, but if you lock them up together in a cage, the chances of survival is looking grim. Similarly, even the most intelligent A.I. is subject to the laws of physics. For example, a warp drive may never be built, not because the A.I. isn&#8217;t smart enough to figure it out, but because it is impossible. We may not have discovered them all, but if such a set of physical laws exists, then any ASI is limited by a (unimaginably high) technological ceiling.</p>
<p>I also think that what happens to us after the introduction of ASI is a moot point. Because we are humans, our attention is biased towards ourselves. It probably won&#8217;t try to wipe us out or grant us immortality, the same way we don&#8217;t try to wipe out ants or try to make their lives better. These are petty human concerns. To me, ASI means a higher form of existence, and we are its conduit, the same way evolution was ours. But we will by then become IRRELEVANT, the same way biological evolution is now compared to technological progress. We would have played our role in increasing the complexity and beauty of the cosmos passing on the baton to the next generation, at least in this corner of the universe.</p>

In fact, it has already slowed down for half a decade and will probably come to a full stop in 2020, limited by quantum mechanical effects.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t agree with this.</p>
<p>1.While it is true that due to some thermal limitations growth in processor&#8217;s clock speed has almost stopped (~2003), further progress, according to Moore&#8217;s law (computational power is doubled over two years) was reached adding another cores to processor. This approach does not speed up sequential program so there is need to change paradigm for parallel programming. There are two ways: 1) multicore cpu&#8217;s (2,4,6,8&#8230;) cores which support heavy threads (branching prediction etc) or 2) manycore GPU&#8217;s (thousands of cores) supporting lightweight-threads (single instruction multiple data). Numerical application with high computational complexity are now mainly implemented on GPU&#8217;s due to high efficiency and low cost &lt;1000USD. </p>
<p>2. Our brain is very slow (for a single instruction point of view) but it&#039;s massively parallel. Artificial neural network is also good example of program that can be parallelized.</p>

<p>As a programmer, I am especially skeptical of what people call AI. </p>
<p>First I think  you have to make the distinction between a machine (an object that follows instructions explicitly), and artificial intelligence -(a machine, program, etc that has two things &#8211; 1. the ability to learn and 2. the ability to use discretion)</p>
<p>Most of what you call artificial intelligence are algorithms. the car that drives itself across San Francisco is a set of complex and fancy algorithms. It does not learn new things about driving, like a 15 year old that realizes braking early for a red makes more sense than braking late. The self driving car simply follows the instructions programmed into it &#8211; a basic basic line of pseudo-code might look something like this &#8212; if (object in front of me == true) { brake(); }<br />
The chess program is also a set of algorithms. If (knight.position(2,7) == true) {move queen() ; } &#8212; or something similar to that. </p>
<p>So those are algorithms. Complex algorithms. Yes, you could make the argument that the chess program could be running on a neural network &#8211; and altering its behavior by adjusting outcomes based on previous rankings of what has worked &#8211; but a program can only do this to the extent that the neural network allows it to.</p>
<p>Now perhaps there are neural networks that allow the machine to alter behavior to push one behavior to higher rankings based on past experience &#8211; this cannot be considered intelligence. It is an &#8216;intelligent program&#8217; but not a form of intelligence. it does not learn what&#8217;s best &#8211; it has no desires to win &#8211; it is simply following instructions that are deemed by past results &#8211; yet the choice to follow that particular instruction is <i>still</i> explicitly programmed. So that brings the concept &#8211; that without desire &#8211; or goals of self determination &#8212; you can&#8217;t really have intelligence..</p>
<p>To have true AI, you would need a program that could literally reprogram itself. Just like a human brain can recreate new paths to learn new skills, or reroute skills through new neurons after a stroke, you would need a program that could literally reprogram itself. Unfortunately, that task would be huge and we (as far as i know) are no where near that today. For instance, there is no such thing as a compiler (or preprocessor) that can recognize an infinite loop.. something that a human with basic programming knowledge could easily recognize. . . So i think its safe to say that we are WAAAAAAYYYY off from any form of actual artificial intelligence.</p>

Interestingly, such a system would probably never become actually &#8220;smart&#8221;, only if it is fed information, that teaches it to be smart. Just as a human without input data from its senses, and a world with structures in it, would never develop to anything you would call intelligent. Funny enough, such a system would still run on a linear operating system, like the ones we use today. The AI part would just be a program, possibly making use of some special hardware. 🙂</p>

<p>Before this kid was in the situation you described it had 15 years of experience of how objects move, how physic physical laws work, how cars accelerate and decelerate etc. It had already learned and seen most of what you described. It already knew a lot about the world, what makes sense and what does not. If you have a toddler, you will see how often it will make completely irrational decision which are intuitive to you, but this is what learning is, you fail before you succeed. </p>

<p>In humans, the pathways are there, but some of them get weaker or some of them get stronger. If the pathways are destroyed, new ones are created. Regret optimization algorithms are a perfect example of learning behavior and closely resembles the human act of &#8220;reprograming&#8221;. When a new situation is encountered, there is a new value added to the database, if this value returns better results, it will be awarded a higher confidence interval, if it returns worse result &#8211; lower confidence interval. If parts of the database are deleted, it will add new values when it encounter a new problem. After many iterations it will eventually find the optimal solution to a given problem. You can compare this learning to a toddler doing math. The first time you ask how much is 2+2, it might tell you 3, eventually it will learn it is 4 and will known it with much higher confidence compared to answering 3.</p>
<p>We have unknown amount of different behavioral characteristics, but if we are able to encode each one of them in computer code, assemble it together and provide all the sensory inputs we have, there is no reason to believe AGI is impossible.</p>

<p>This is true, and a good description of machine learning (neural networks &#8211; and how modern search engine algs work). That being said, it is still fundamentally an algorithm that has determined that behavior &#8211; the behavior of placing weights on different options. The choosing isn&#8217;t determined by the machine &#8211; but by the programmer. If a moving weighted average mechanism is what defines AI, i don&#8217;t think we are differentiating it from any complex machine. I mean a dishwasher has functions where it makes decisions based on current temperature, timers, soap left, etc.. but we wouldn&#8217;t call it AI. I&#8217;m not saying we can&#8217;t simulate intelligence &#8211; I am simply saying that AI must be a machine that can generate its own code ( a system that has its own goals &#8211; <i>not</i> a merely a mechanism )- otherwise were not making a true distinction between &#8216;smart machine&#8217; and artificial intelligence. Neural networks can only allow a machine to learn via the pre-defined parameters set by the programmer. It can only compare a scenario with other programmed scenarios &#8211; and most of the time the outcome (the setting of future weights upon neural networks) is determined by human involvement (i.e. google image results). I&#8217;m not saying its impossible &#8211; i am saying its a long way off &#8211; unless were going to redefine what AI is.</p>

<p>I understand what you are saying, but we have philosophical difference of opinion. </p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think there is a philosophical difference between a biological and mechanical structures, it&#8217;s just a different substrate. Biological organisms have a goal to procreate. Why? Because any organism without such goal, would eventually cease to exist due to the laws of physics. If we accept this, then humans do not truly have free will, merely the illusion of it and every layer of complexity above this basic goal is nothing but a supplement to it. We often make choices contradicting this basic goal which gives us the illusion of free will, but we can attribute this to the fallibility of our biological computer to make bad choices even if we have already encountered the situation or in computer jargon &#8211; to use the wrong values from our database.</p>
<p>What I am saying is, if we create a mechanical structure with the only goal to procreate, and give it the ability to change it&#8217;s structure, there is a high chance it will develop gradually to an structure fit to procreate. Would it develop intelligence or not? Well, we don&#8217;t have an answer for this, but if intelligence is useful for procreation, then it will.</p>

<p>&#8216;[H]uman beings could be as easily felled by a single idea as by cholera or the bubonic plague. There was no immunity to cuckoo ideas on Earth.&#8217;</p>
<p>&#8216;And here, according to [Kilgore] Trout, was the reason human beings could not reject ideas because they were bad: &#8220;Ideas on Earth were badges of friendship or enmity. Their content did not matter. Friends agreed with friends, in order to express friendliness. Enemies disagreed with enemies, in order to express enmity.&#8221;&#8216;</p>
<p>&#8220;The ideas Earthlings held didn&#8217;t matter for hundreds of thousands of years, since they couldn&#8217;t do much about them anyway. Ideas might as well be badges as anything. And then Earthlings discovered tools. Suddenly agreeing with friends could be a form of suicide or worse. But agreements went on, not for the sake of common sense or decency or self-preservation, but for friendliness.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Earthlings went on being friendly, when they should have been thinking instead. And even when they built computers to do some thinking for them, they designed them not so much for wisdom as for friendliness. So they were doomed.&#8221;&#8216;</p>

I do agree, that giving too much importance to it &#8220;being friendly&#8221; might end up being really counter productive.

Even if you have to blow the scale way out beyond the 21st century, the statement &#8220;between the creation of a true ASI in the 21st or 22nd century, and the time that mankind and all its creations and technology are destroyed (potentially billions of years), an ASI will control some form of physical body&#8221; is not an absurd gamble. So long as we don&#8217;t nuke/cook ourselves to death before we&#8217;re able to build one, odds are that it&#8217;s a &#8220;when&#8221; and not an &#8220;if&#8221;.</p>
<p>In terms of how it would go about achieving those results (if it decided it even wanted to), the difference in brain power we&#8217;re talking about is so great that the answer might as well be &#8220;magic.&#8221; </p>
<p>It would be like a fruit fly wondering how humans split the atom. We split it within the confines of the same universal rules that the fly exists in, but the fly isn&#8217;t capable of understanding even the most basic of the tools we used to get to that point.</p>

A turing machine just reads some input does some processing and delivers some output. Now, if we don&#8217;t shift the paradigm very soon then we will not evolve too much. And again, the cpu power means nothing regarding AI. If you want to do fast computation, is ok but tha&#8217;t like playing life in 2d when you really have is 3d.<br />
OK ? and please stop calling our mobile phone ANI 🙂 is just a dumb phone with a set of instruction, nothing intelligent there. Our mobile phone is the same as it was 10 years ago but with better performance and specs but, in truth, does the same thing. The problem can be translated this way: the only thing we do better is that we are running faster, which somehow is a good thing but what we really want is to fly 🙂</p>

The matter human and animal brains made up by has nothing special; indeed we have sccessfully simulated the brain of a roundworm (ca. 300 neurons).

<p>I think there is no reason to discard the existence of an organisation principle &#8211; my notation for this vital essence you&#8217;re beautifully quoting &#8211; even if we understand a few of Nature mechanisms (such as cell biology, biochemistry, etc). These facts indicate that Nature creates in a realistic way, with technics and processes. With a logos. </p>
<p>Good for us : we don&#8217;t live in a mystical world.  </p>
<p>The question remains : what is creating in Nature ? As for our practical minds, we consider rules and randomness to lead this world because it is hard to conceive something else which doesn&#8217;t sound totally crazy. And also because we love to observe rules and pretend that &#8220;Yes ! We got it !&#8221; But what is creating these rules (Stephen Hawking question I do apply here) ? And how can we explain the existence of the universe if we don&#8217;t have, at some point, one creative principle (my question I do apply here) ?</p>
<p>These are hard questions to answer, especially with a poor knowledge of ourselves. </p>
<p>If someone tries to create a work of art, he may find himself facing a different vision of what he has inside &#8211; emotions, instincts, and other non rational stuff &#8211; and how this stuff helps him creating once he understands how it works.<br />
I think considering creation from the inside &#8211; the so called subjective experience described by a very interesting science called psychology &#8211; brings valuable informations. </p>
<p>More than informations, these are experiences that can slightly change the views on different things. Consciousness for instance.</p>

That&#8217;ll open your eyes.</p>
<p>Not only have phones jumped on to a level few imaged only a few years ago, there is now also a huge market in Apps and other bits of software for them, and they run games that your home console couldn&#8217;t cope with a decade ago, whilst still having enough power left over to go a day without a charger, and to realise when a call is coming in, and talk to your WIFI, Bluetooth and other wireless technologies, and to track the 3 axis motion of the phone, charge state, temperature, and so on. You can also take some pretty good photos at resolutions that were out of reach for most a few years ago (though that&#8217;s slowed a bit, as 8MP is about as good as anyone needs really unless they are doing something special, and there&#8217;s one mobile with a 120MP camera built in) but that you can then manipulate however you want and then near instantly put online for others to look at &#8211; and do that with video too.</p>
<p>So yes, it&#8217;s just a dumb phone&#8230;</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-274572" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;m very skeptical about all of this, for several reasons. Here&#8217;s three: </p>
<p>1) Natural resources are limited. Right now, some of the metals we use to make electronic hardware are actually rare, difficult and expensive to mine for. All of them exist in limited quantities on the earth. So there might come a time where we&#8217;re not producing such a crazy amount of computers and smartphones anymore, because they will become too expensive. </p>
<p>2) Its too reductive to limit the definition of intelligence to what happens inside our brains, without taking into account our physical body and its ability to alter the world around us. A computer could not come up with scientific theories just by &#8220;thinking&#8221;! Like us it would need to experiment and test its hypothesis against observable reality. As much as &#8220;thinking time&#8221; can be reduced by increasing the number of cps, experimenting time is incompressible. So it&#8217;s not just about copying the brain, one would also need to copy/invent a machine capable of physically interacting with the world in the same sophisticated way we do it, and give it enough time to experiment and experience.</p>
<p>3) Computers now run on electricity, and turning off the switch is all it would take for us to destroy a machine if it gets too crazy for us.</p>

<p>2) Compared with the complexity of the brain, the rest of the human body (or any physical interface the A.I. is going to have) is rather trivial. This is why I think letting an A.I. come up with the cure for cancer is an absurd idea, because building an A.I. is a lot harder (not sure though, I&#8217;m no biologist). You&#8217;re right though about experimenting &#8211; No matter how smart the A.I. will be, we&#8217;ll still need that giant accelerator 😉</p>

<p>It seems to me that there are two major flaws in this type of thinking. The first, pointed out in numerous other comments, is the limits of exponential growth; just because advancement has accelerated at the rate we&#8217;ve seen, doesn&#8217;t mean it can or will continue to do so ad infinitum. There are all kinds of possible physical and practical limits that may see the rate of ACCELERATION of change level out, and perhaps even some day diminish.</p>
<p>The second is that I think that we have dramatically overestimated our own knowledge and intelligence, and the significance of our accomplishments as a species. I&#8217;m not saying that modern technology today isn&#8217;t mind blowing in its way. It truly is, and it amazes the crap out of me. But I think that we overestimate its significance. In the end, what&#8217;s the fancy stuff we can really do? We are really good at making mechanical machines that can manipulate and navigate the physical world around us at various scales; we are really good at making fancy-ass calculators that can crunch lots and lots of numbers really fast; we are really good at observing, describing and making models of what&#8217;s going on in the world around us; and perhaps most impressively, we&#8217;ve learned how to take advantage of electromagnetic radiation for long-range communication purposes. Most of this has been achieved through a lot of bumbling and accident, that has then been built on through investigation and experimentation &#8211; which is all extremely laudible and impressive, but I think it gives us a really overinflated sense of how well we understand the universe, and what we&#8217;re capable of.</p>
<p>But ultimately, we don&#8217;t really understand how or why anything works beyond a descriptive, superficial level. And we underestimate how much we don&#8217;t know by orders and orders of magnitude. We&#8217;ve stumbled onto and then refined all of this really really cool stuff, led by incredibly smart, hard-working people, which is laudable, amazing, and wonderful, but it&#8217;s given us an overinflated sense of our knowledge and capabilities. On the scale of understanding how a brain works (even a flatworm brain), I think we are at toddler levels of understanding, while thinking we&#8217;re at undergrad-level understanding (if full professor represents full understanding).</p>
<p>Finally, the fact that all of these smart people and scientist Tim references believe this is all possible isn&#8217;t, in this particular instance, very convincing to me. I love science, and I love scientists, but I do think that scientists are often the most deluded into believing their own press, in terms of overestimating what we know and what we&#8217;re capable of. I&#8217;d be really curious to hear the take of a theoretical physicist though, since it seems to me that as a discipline, that branch of science actually brings with it quite a lot of humility and perspective one what we actually do and can know.</p>

<p>But ultimately, we don&#8217;t REALLY understand how or why anything works beyond a descriptive, superficial level, but we mistake our descriptive and modeling abilities for understanding. And we underestimate how much we don&#8217;t know by orders and orders of magnitude. We&#8217;ve stumbled onto and then refined all of this really really cool stuff, led by incredibly smart, hard-working people, which is laudable, amazing, and wonderful, but it&#8217;s given us an overinflated sense of our knowledge and capabilities. On the scale of understanding how a brain works (even a flatworm brain), I think we are at toddler levels of understanding, while thinking we&#8217;re at undergrad-level understanding (if full professor represents full understanding).</p>
<p>Finally, the fact that all of these smart people and scientist Tim references believe this is all possible isn&#8217;t, in this particular instance, very convincing to me. I love science, and I love scientists, but I do think that scientists are often the most deluded into believing their own press, in terms of overestimating what we know and what we&#8217;re capable of. I&#8217;d be really curious to hear the take of a theoretical physicist though, since it seems to me that as a discipline, that branch of science actually brings with it quite a lot of humility and perspective one what we actually do and can know.</p>

They just are very impressive compared to our own past, which is our only point of reference when judging our accomplishments. We are also the only being in the universe thus far known to be able to judge the significance of&#8230; anything, really. And we have not underestimated the unknown; we simply don&#8217;t have an estimate at all, that&#8217;s why they&#8217;re called unknowns.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t see how we will ever reach an understanding beyond the &#8220;descriptive, superficial level&#8221;, because all science does is describing the natural world as accurately as possible, with a model as simple as possible. Philosophical ideas that most people consider as more fundamental and important, such as &#8220;Do we live in a simulation&#8221; or &#8220;Is there life after death&#8221; can neither be confirmed nor falsified by experimental and observational evidence.</p>
<p>I think scientists, while they may be wrong, are the people more qualified than anyone else to make predictions regarding the field they&#8217;re working on, and also likely to use careful wording because they know the weight of burden of proof. There are, however, many deluded people who think of themselves as scientists, and run around telling the &#8220;truth&#8221; 😉</p>

But I do think that we overestimate some of them &#8211; particularly in the realm of organics: biology, medicine, etc. So much of what we know in terms of medical advances, for example, are based on lucky things we&#8217;ve stumbled into and then strategically made the most of.</p>
<p>And while it&#8217;s true that in many areas we can&#8217;t know how many unknowns remain, the chances are that we are closer to minimal knowledge on most things than maximal. We laugh it the ignorance of people in the past, how wrong they were about so many things, (flat earth, solar system, leaches, etc); major thinkers believed that science had reached its apotheosis at the beginning of the 20th century and that there was little more to learn&#8230;right before relativity blew everyone away, with quantum mechanics on its heals. Because we can&#8217;t imagine the unknowable we tend to think there isn&#8217;t much more to know, and yet there is usually quite a lot.</p>
<p>In terms of the descriptiveness of scientific understanding, I probably should have used different wording, because you&#8217;re right, deeper layers of &#8220;hows&#8221; and &#8220;whys&#8221; really just amount to deeper layers of description. Nonetheless, our understandings of many things are extremely superficial. We&#8217;ve mapped out so much about the brain, brain regions, neurons, etc &#8211; we know so much about which parts of the brain become active under what circumstances. And yet in terms of actually understanding what on earth the brain is actually DOING, how it REALLY works, I think we&#8217;re pretty clueless &#8211; and yet I think it is likely that that is knowable.</p>

Doesn&#8217;t the fact that we are on the minimal side mean that we still have a lot to learn? And doesn&#8217;t that compound with the theory that our knowledge is still evolving and should be doing so at an acclerating rate?<br />
Another point that doesn&#8217;t help is that you state all of our flaws and our limits in understanding the universe. What the article says is not that <em>we</em> will understand everything, it&#8217;s the super-intelligent computer that will quickly learn things.</p>

<p>As far as our limitations in understanding, what I&#8217;m saying is that I think we are much much further away from creating a super intelligent computer than we think we are. I am of the opinion (though I recognize that ultimately it is just a hunch since I can&#8217;t truly know) that consciousness and self-awareness can never be produced in AI &#8211; though it can be simulated &#8211; but it will always just be unthinking lines of code. But I don&#8217;t think that we understand intelligence, or brains, or any of that as well as we think we do, and it gives us the illusion that we are many orders of magnitude closer to creating human-like intelligence than we think we are.</p>

It was benign and willing to answer and solve any world problem. Quantum physics, ecology, economy&#8230; discussion on any and every topic was possible. All went week for a while, with life enhancing advances made in the blink of an eye. However the computer was being asked many questions that it struggled to answer&#8230; and these were about human emotions&#8230; &#8220;Why doesn&#8217;t he love me anymore&#8230; why did she die?&#8221; As the computer&#8217;s knowledge about the human psyche evolved it became more and more depressed about the challenges and moral responsibilities faced by man, until one day it could bear it no more and destroyed itself along with all its accumulated knowledge. I don&#8217;t remember the story&#8217;s title or author but the emotion of reading this, particularly the last chapter has stayed with me for almost 50 years. AI will mean EI too and that can only be human.</p>

People would talk about it as if it was almost certain &#8211; but nobody talked about an actual strategy of building one &#8211; and demand for flying cars never really was a thing.  </p>
<p>Similarly, Everyone talks about AI but I haven&#8217;t heard one coherent concept of how to go about creating it (I talk about my definition of true AI below..). Also do we need it? There is definitely demand for smart machines, like self driving cars and Nest but is there really a demand for machine consciousness? I kind of doubt it. So why don&#8217;t we focus on what we do well such as building smart machines.. and leave the theory as just that. As engineers we have been an extremely successful species &#8211; but for creating artificial life.. not so much.</p>

You&#8217;re thinking that somebody from the year 2000 wouldn&#8217;t be super surprised, in my opinion, because you lived all of these years and you got used to the progress.<br />
Even today I am surprised that in Korea they have 50 Mbps internet as the average and at my house I barely get 3 Mbps.<br />
Regarding the level of progress specifically, you have to look at certain areas where the advances are being made at the fastest pace: calculation power, for example. In 1900 there was the abaccus. In 1950 we had huge mechanical calculators. From 1980 to 1985 we went from pocket calculators to computers, and then computers evolved super fast. The other important thing to consider is that THIS progress is what could bring further process at a pace that we can barely keep up with.<br />
If we train computers to do scientists&#8217; jobs very well and quickly there&#8217;s no telling what progress will be made by 2030 that a 1999 person could never dream of.</p>

And by the fact that most of the advancement (taking into account the S-curve pattern Tim mentioned) of the past 16 years has been intangible&#8211;it&#8217;s not about flying cars vs. horses, it&#8217;s about 56k modems vs. streaming HD video. </p>
<p>For example, 1999 me was just barely aware of the concept of Email. 2015 me runs a business based in The Cloud. Not just the tools of my trade, but (in a lot of ways) the current iterations of my whole occupation, were not even possible in &#8217;99. Grade school me could not have conceived how 2015 me lives and works on a daily basis, he just did not have the information needed to make those predictions. </p>
<p>Or even better, I imagine taking my parents, circa my birth date, and bringing them forward to today and seeing if they could navigate Windows 8 on a tablet. (Actually, if they figure it out, they can show me). </p>
<p>Sometimes I think that those of us born before ~1990 have already lived through a singularity (albeit a small one) and just didn&#8217;t notice&#8211;the creation of the internet and proliferation of personal computing. The pace was juuuust slow enough that we all kept up. Like the proverbial frog that doesn&#8217;t notice the water getting hotter until he&#8217;s boiled o.0</p>

<p>This is not my field of expertise, but it seems to me the we had multiple paradigm-shifting inventions/discoveries in the 20th century in multiple fields which completely altered everyday life (general relativity, quantum mechanics, antibiotics, organ transplants, internal combustion engine, nuclear power, integrated circuits, satellite communication). I don&#8217;t see how we can compare that to the innovations made in the last 15 years, however remarkable they have been.</p>

However, I find this extreme degree of technological optimism difficult to take in. At its root what you&#8217;re saying is that as long as we forge ahead we&#8217;ll continue to conquer everything in our path (until we are potentially wiped out by ASI). Therefore, no need to worry about the huge planetary predicament we&#8217;re in. The truth is that the world has limits.</p>
<p>The real reason that the rate of technological advancement sped up so fast from the mid-18th century is because we discovered and began to exploit fossil fuels, a practice that has put us in a precarious position by the 21st century. In short, our rate of progress is an illusion. It&#8217;s based on the exhaustion of a finite resource, the use of which is putting into question the ability of life to survive on this planet (here&#8217;s another group of scientists, &#8216;smarter and more knowledgeable than you or I&#8217;, with a dire warning: <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/15/rate-of-environmental-degradation-puts-life-on-earth-at-risk-say-scientists" rel="nofollow">http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2015/jan/15/rate-of-environmental-degradation-puts-life-on-earth-at-risk-say-scientists</a>).</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve got more pressing problems than pursuing ASI. Any such entity would presumably require a source of energy, which soon may be sorely lacking. And it would be bound by the same physical realities as us.</p>
<p>A lot of great thoughts, but a lot of legitimate reason for skepticism.</p>

What we don&#8217;t know is if these problems will be solved at the same time that we improve existing AI. So developing better AI instead of worrying about climate change could actually lead to climate change being solved by accident through AI. We just don&#8217;t know how it&#8217;ll work out.<br />

If it is a &#8220;benevolent god,&#8221; it will help us expand into the cosmos whereas if it is malicious it may choose to eliminate us, and live in its&#8217; utopian-machine world and build a dyson-sphere around its&#8217; host star etc. I seems to me that the creation of an ASI void of any human context could be quite volatile. Instead we might think of using a collection of existing humans&#8217; memories and experiences to create a sort of &#8220;human context&#8221; for an artificial intelligence. Would the world benefit from an ASI created on the foundation of a single human&#8217;s mind? What if it were a modern-day Adolf Hitler? Could we convince the world to upload the Dalai Lama&#8217;s mind?</p>
<p> Instead it would make more sense to give people the option of &#8220;giving&#8221; their memories to the AI so it could better understand them and help answer whatever questions or needs the person might have. Each person&#8217;s additional life&#8217;s memories and experiences could give such an ASI the one thing it can never have or experience: regular human life. Such context, in a broad enough sample size, might show our ASI that the human race is like you explained it in a previous post: a little orphan on an abandon rock in some lost corner of our spiral. We can only hope that with this understanding an ASI would think of us as worth saving.</p>

A pretty logical conclusion would be to kill everyone, and stop the perpetual suffering. In fact, to be sure, all existence must be wiped out, to ensure suffering can not take place ever again, anywhere. 🙂 And if you are thinking of filtering who&#8217;s mind gets copied, and who&#8217;s isn&#8217;t, than the perspective will be skewed, and nothing good could come of that. Not to mention, who gets to decide? Also, the Dalai Lama (Tendzin Gyaco) is not as nice a guy, as you might think. There are no good humans, they are all crazy, just in different ways. If you want to make sure, that that poor AI is just as screwed as we are, than this would be a good way to go about it. I do agree, that it would be best if AI grew up in a human context, but this is not the way.</p>

<p>Why should it want to be benevolent? That implies emotion, and a desire to help us out of love, or because it benefits the AI. </p>
<p>Why should it be malicious? Again, implied emotion that it dislikes us, or that it thinks we are NOT beneficial or directly harmful.</p>
<p>Big question, why does it care what is beneficial/harmful? Those are assessments based on a living thing&#8217;s point of view, driven by a desire to survive and/or reproduce. Why should a computer have either? Why should it care if it dies? Why should it have any ambitions at all? Humans want to explore, create, love, fight, learn&#8211;would even an extremely intelligent and capable computer want to do anything? Is it even capable of feeling bored? Boredom is just a restless feeling that comes when we aren&#8217;t pursuing any of those other activities.</p>
<p>I think we could give it some emotions or goals in the AGI stages, but once it hits ASI it&#8217;ll pretty much be free to rewrite any part of itself it sees fit, and our initial inputs would be meaningless. Would an ASI retain any instincts? </p>
<p>What&#8217;s to say we don&#8217;t wind up creating an effective god that doesn&#8217;t want to do anything besides ignore us and sit still?</p>
<p>Of course, it might just wind up being a dick.</p>

There are in fact a couple experiments I&#8217;ve read about (maybe on here?) currently trying to determine if the universe we live in is actually a hologram. </p>
<p>Which is kind of funny, until someone points out that so long as technology continues to advance with time, then in thousands/millions/billions of years of potential future, eventually the ability to create a nearly perfect simulated universe is inevitable. And statistically, you&#8217;re more likely to be one of exponentially more not-born-yet-in-2015-humans than one of the original 7 billion who lived on earth in 2015. </p>
<p>Assuming earth is even a real place and we&#8217;re not all actually an artificial intelligence. Or space dolphins playing an absurd video game. </p>

But saying that we progress exponentially does not mean that we will continue do so in future as well. If we look at it, most of our technological advancements are related to machines that can calculate, do physical work, etc. etc. But we are yet to understand the brain even a slight bit. So, may be, in coming future we will see more of the &#8220;cool&#8221; machines, but the same logic do not apply to AI development as well. In fact, with the same logic as &#8220;we will develop and advance with the same exponential rate as in the past&#8221;, it might be possible that we never reach ASI level. We have to think about the past progress in ASI industry only. Making &#8220;cool&#8221; computers is very different than making &#8220;human-level-intelligence&#8221;. And although, we have succeeded in making &#8220;cool&#8221; computers, we may find it VERY, VERY hard to create an ASI. Or at the least, we may take a VERY, VERY long time to do that.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-274802" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Moore&#8217;s &#8220;Law&#8221; (an observation really) has already broken down in a strict sense, and its total breakdown will become even more obvious in the next decade. Past performance does not guarantee anything in the future. In this respect there is another &#8220;law&#8221; worth remembering, namely Herbert Stein&#8217;s, particularly with respect to exponential growth trends (ike Moore&#8217;s &#8220;Law&#8221;): &#8220;If something cannot go on forever, it will stop&#8221;. Another point regarding computing power from this piece, you say &#8220;while today’s microprocessors (which are much slower than they will be when we reach AGI) run at 2 GHz&#8221; &#8211; here you postulate that future processors will run at a higher frequency than 2GHz. The fact is that due to the breakdown of Dennard scaling over 10 years ago due to physical limits being reached in the fabrication of microprocessors, microprocessors being produced today actually run at a slower frequency than microprocessors produced in 2004 and the trend line for microprocessor frequency has been flat or negative since 2004.</p>
<p>Computing power is still improving per dollar spent, but it is also a salient example of a growth trend which many people became accustomed to assuming would continue on an exponential curve forever just because it was on such a curve for 4, 5, or 6 decades. Well, actually that growth curve has already ended and now we are entering a much more modest rate of growth of traditional silicon based computing power.</p>
<p>This is not to say that traditional computing will not be replaced with another form of computing which will give us another exponential curve to become accustomed to, just that any exponential growth curve can come to an end, no matter how long it has been in evidence for and there is no guarantee that another such curve will be found to ride for the next 4, 5 or 6 decades.</p>

<p>When a neural network &#8220;learns&#8221;, it does so with a purpose e.g. to win the game of chess; and it does so based on computations and rules. When a human being learns, it does so without a purpose, it just interacts and keeps absorbing experiences.</p>

Philosophy at its best gives us new ways to think about reality which can be acted upon, but then it&#8217;s science. So much philosophy about theory of mind and purpose is so much nonsense.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s no reason we can&#8217;t create purposeful algorithms the purpose of which is to create behaviour similar to ours that involves learning without purpose, or at least simulate that behaviour with a pattern or whole range of changing patterns.</p>
<p>And again, if you can&#8217;t work out the philosophy, there&#8217;s no reason a ASI couldn&#8217;t. If it doesn&#8217;t decide that&#8217;s a waste of computation, that is.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-278682" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>About a theory of consciousness &#8211; which merges science and a practical philosophy &#8211; I strongly recommand to read Mr Carl Gustav Jung, starting with &#8220;man and his symbols&#8221;. He explains psychological evolution not as an increasing calculatory capacity but as a coherent intergration of our emotional, instinctual and rational capacities. </p>
<p>I think he gave most of the answer about consciousness, a refined capacity to analyse and compute which is plugged onto other psychic capacities, rather archaic, fuzzy and greatly efficient in some areas. These capacities are much more difficult to crush into a paradigm, especially because we live our life from our consciousness. Althought, he did to some extent, relating it to Nature&#8217;s evolution, stating that our psyche evolved the same way our body did. In that vision, consciousness appears as the latest function, the most refined one, which permits to organize more efficiently the rest of the psyche &#8211; erasing instinctual superstitions for instance. </p>
<p>And to ensure its own evolution, consciousness needs the archaic &#8220;natural parts&#8221; of the psyche. It doesn&#8217;t have the key to its own evolution. Alone, it can only evolve in a robotic, controlling and destructive way as the Matrix &#8211; and the world &#8211; express greatly.</p>
<p>The huge problem with that theory is that you may get the concepts, still, you&#8217;ll be unable to do anything with it as long as you don&#8217;t experience them. And the same applies to most human theories, espescialy the ones about orgasm 😉</p>

I think you are missing a natural barrier that I see in science (that may be another post altoghter&#8230;) is that new ideas in technology often take at least a generation before they get traction.  How many times do you hear the &#8220;breakthrough&#8221; story of some invention and then they give credit to someone decades earlier for the genesis of the idea &#8220;but no one believed him.&#8221;<br />
Especially in modern acedemics it is very important to be Right.  New breakthroughs challenge what we already &#8220;know&#8221; to be true and are therefore limited until an emerging generation can give them a fair hearing.<br />
This could create a barrier to your exponental curve, until of course AI takes over and doesn&#8217;t care about being percieved as &#8220;Right&#8221; like us silly humans!<br />

Other breakthroughs such as the idea of Higgs Boson  was credited half a century later (Nobel Prize 2013) because only now have we found the evidence for its existence. The string theory for example, is given little credibility, not because scientists can&#8217;t wrap their heads around this idea, but because we would need to build a particle accelerator the size of the solar system to verify it. Not happening anytime soon.</p>
<p>In engineering, revolutionary concepts sometimes need a very long time to mature and become applicable. Sometimes we fail to see the true potential of a new concept until much later. This is not unreasonable however, because there is a cost to a failed investment in potentially revolutionary technologies. Sometimes economics dictates that this new technology can&#8217;t outcompete the existing ones until much later (such as electric cars and solar power).</p>
<p>Given the importance of technological progress in our culture, I don&#8217;t think stubbornness is the thing that&#8217;s holding us back.</p>

We had computational progress prior to the transistor, with vacuum tubes and so on, and we will have progress once chip shrinkage reaches its limit, with something like photonic computing, and perhaps in the not too distant future, quantum computing. While there is a limit to computing power, we&#8217;ve not even scratched the surface of what we could do with computers. Cognitive computing is on the near horizon, quantum computing later. A quantum computer would increase many aspects of computing by a trillion fold.</p>

We are not even grain of sand on Earth compared to vastness of universes and it is logical for me to conclude that our scientifically  achievements are flawed. I would say that our understanding of world around us is simplified (as quantum physics first suggested) and that we are yet to find better ways of explaining how universe works. With that in mind I think that our current math, physics will take us only so far (maybe 100, maybe 500 years) but at one moment will stop and have to re-think way we look at universe. But one thing is for certain, when we look last 300 years, we are awesome and we are getting better at everything.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-275505" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;d just like to make the point that progression isn&#8217;t always exponential, and in fact sometimes is far slower than most people anticipate.</p>
<p>As an example look at the field of space exploration.</p>
<p>Look at any sci fi flic or futurologist projection from the 50&#8217;s, 60&#8217;s about today and you&#8217;ll see they typically all overshoot the mark. 2001 A Space Odyssey is the quintessential example.</p>
<p>People in the late 60&#8217;s and 70&#8217;s looked back at the phenomenal growth in space &#8220;tech&#8221; over the last two decades, and projected that growth onto 2001. And they were way off, even as restrained as that movie was in its predictions.</p>
<p>Now here comes my point; technology and progress isn&#8217;t a simple numerical number (HumanProgressIndex) that progresses at a certain rate; it is split up into a myriad of different fields or &#8220;pools&#8221; that touch on each other and interact in various ways.</p>
<p>The growth within one &#8220;pool&#8221; could very well be exponential, but once the pool is &#8220;full&#8221; we need a radican paradigm shift to advance to the next one.</p>
<p>To keep with the space exploration example: Making the first chemical rocket to acchieve orbit was hard &#8211; ok. Then as we gained more and more experience in rocket science, materials science etc, the growth in this field was exponential. Or following the &#8220;s-curve&#8221; the article mentioned. </p>
<p>And at some points we reach chemical rocket &#8220;maturity&#8221;. And one can argue when that happened or will happen but I&#8217;d say somewhere in the 80&#8217;s (although I&#8217;m aware of the space X reusable rocket testing, i still feel this is just &#8220;perfecting&#8221; an already mature technology).</p>
<p>Now with mature chemical rockets we realized the economics of space exploration: We can&#8217;t really do all those nifty things you see in the 60&#8217;s sci-fi with them, and we&#8217;re stuck here. </p>
<p>There is no more exponential growth.</p>
<p>We probably need something radically new to advance, like anti-gravity or something even more exotic, which would require massive advances in fields that are, for now, UNRELATED to space flight.</p>
<p>Instead of thinking of our &#8220;progress&#8221; as a 1-dimensional number it makes more sense to think of it as an expanding circle, pushing outward in all directions at different speeds, making globulus advances into new pools of knowledge</p>
<p>that makes for a shitty graph though; i understand your simpllification 🙂</p>

To put that in this context: the progress in computing power is exponential and following Moore&#8217;s law for a while, but will stop at one point. And developing AI is much closer to being a linear process so even if the brute computing power would exceed that of the human brain by a factor of 10^n, we&#8217;d still probably be just buildings more fancy ANIs that just happen to have a bigger boxes than ANIs of today.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-276069" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I think the main difficulty here is the assumed exponential advance of these technologies.  I think kurzweil&#8217;s observation that development follows s-curves is correct.  A new paradigm develops, followed by a period of rapid development, and then a slow down as the technology matures. </p>
<p>But what I think is getting ignored is that new paradigms also become exponentially more difficult to imagine as time goes on. The explosion of technological advances after the Renaissance came from the paradigm of the Scientific Method &#8212; a way of examing and testing the world.   We are just now starting to exhaust all the low hanging fruit that way of thinking opened up.</p>
<p>This means that progress is a series of little s-curves on big s-curves, *not* exponentials. </p>
<p>The next 500 years may just be a long stretch of slow progress until a new paradigm of thinking comes about to lead to the next revolution.</p>
<p>All hypotheses of the singularity *assume* a new paradigm is right around the corner.  They must assume this because neuroscience makes *clear* that the human brain is not merely a faster, bigger computer.  Faster ANI does not lead to AGI.  All the &#8220;advances&#8221; in AI, like Siri, are merely due to speed and better statistical models.  Siri will never become the AI in Her. </p>
<p>The *very best* that type of AI can become would be something like the voice interface computers in Star Trek &#8212; they understand what you want as long as you are requesting something that can be looked-up or computed, and you ask very explicitly.  But they&#8217;re not &#8220;smart&#8221; or capable of taking over anything.  They&#8217;re mere tools. </p>
<p>The point to get scared of the singularity is when someone can make a robot that can perform all the amazingly complicated behaviors of say a bumblebee.  The phone is your pocket as vastly more computing power than a bumblebee brain, but yet,we still have no AI bumblebees. </p>

If ASI appears from technologically-extended-humans, it would be a kind of higher level life being, that would need resources to maintain and multiply. Regarding the difficulties humanity (kind of first ASI actually) will face for consuming exponentially more resources, my question would be: does any kind of ASI higher than humanity would survive on earth or find on earth the resources to conquer some other place in the universe ?</p>

<p> Disclaimer: I think AI is possible. I think AI smarter than humans is possible. I think that AI explosion (or singularity itself for that matter) is NOT possible.</p>
<p>&#8220;An AI system at a certain level—let’s say human village idiot—is programmed with the goal of improving its own intelligence.&#8221;<br />
Ask actual village idiot to self-improve. You may be dissappointed with results. Ok, that was jab, main criticism below.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once it does, it’s smarter—maybe at this point it’s at Einstein’s level—so now when it works to improve its intelligence, with an Einstein-level intellect, it has an easier time and it can make bigger leaps.&#8221;<br />
There is big, BIG assumption that is assumed as certain without justification or any explanation. He basically claims that if you are more intelligent, being even more intelligent is&#8230; somehow&#8230; easier (???). I never seen anywhere justification for it, here or elsewhere. It was never observed &#8211; certainly not in humans. It is just&#8230; assumed. Sigh.</p>
<p>It is beyond me why anyone would think that, considering our daily experience with intelligences higher than said village idiot. Author seems to think AI = MAGIC!!!111.</p>
<p>Summary: this article is typical crackpottery in transhuman flavour. Convince me that dividing bacteria can in few weeks turn entire planet in biomass full of said bacteria (hey, mathematically it works out!) and I may entertain idea that expotential growth of AI is possible. Until then, I will consider it just transhumanist fantasy.</p>

Here&#8217;s the thing, an AI could rewrite itself, and make numerous copies trying out which version of itself was smarter &#8211; an option simply not available to humans or any biological creature. You could then fall back onto a &#8220;look at bacteria&#8221; argument but bacteria doesn&#8217;t have an agenda &#8211; it just mindlessly reproduces until something limits it. An AI would be evaluating each step of its own evolution of which iterations were occurring on nanosecond scales. My point is not that you are wrong, it&#8217;s simply that we don&#8217;t have any lifeform to use analogously to demonstrate a &#8220;proof&#8221; of how an AI would evolve. I hope you are right &#8211; because then AI will be nothing but a clever tool for making our lives easier (in the right hands obviously), I still fear you are not&#8230;</p>

I know. This is why I said it was just jab (mean side comment).</p>
<p>&#8220;bacteria doesn&#8217;t have an agenda&#8221;<br />
Having agenda or not does not matter. AI can&#8217;t make laws of physics optional. It can be only so fast, it can optimize itself only so much, it can change only in certain amount of time and needing certain amount of resources (cpu time, speed, amount of RAM and disk space are only most obvious).</p>
<p>My prediction is that we will have super-AIs&#8230; eventually. It will take centuries to work, tinker, having lesser AI toiling endlessly to create something better that they are. And, most importantly, despite what everyone seems to assume, it will be harder with each step.</p>
<p>You simply DO NOT have endless expotential growth in anything, be it bacterial growth, AI intelligence, processor speed, star lifecycle, technology itself or whatever else you have. You can have this kind of growth, sure, but only for a while, until it chokes down and stop due to various constraints.</p>

We cannot assume that an AI of village idiot level can optimise itself to Einstein level in one shot. For sure it can work all day long on this task, and use computer&#8217;s modularity to test large numbers of configuration, algorithms and so on. But one thing is that it would have undoubtedly a very long code, that needs long step to be set up (compilation, install, loading) in each step. And optimisation with long steps takes a HUGE amount of time. OK Moore&#8217;s law is here, but if we don&#8217;t find a new way to conceive computers, well be soon limited by atomic size as someone else posted.<br />
AND, it&#8217;s a big assumption that it&#8217;s easy to recode in a smarter way. The way you described AGI, it&#8217;s good at many human tasks. OK but does it have creativity? How do you teach creativity to a computer?<br />
And let&#8217;s assume that this computer gets to an IQ of 300. How can you be so sure that getting to 12000 is feasible SHORTLY? We could simply reach limits in the way the tech will works, so the computer not only needs to do some code to become an ASI, but needs to develop a new hardware architecture (with 300 in IQ it should be able to) to then run a new higher version.<br />
But then (final point I promise), have you heard of convergence? I work on mechanical engineering, and when running optimisation codes, we need to get the simulation convergence. That&#8217;s when you know your model is fine enough (usually when you&#8217;ve put enough elements) to get a result correct given the inputs. That also when the optimisation engine reach am optimum, which can be local (with an other way you can get higher) or global. What if we reach such a point much more rapidly than some thinks, and that it takes decades to pass it?</p>

<p>15 years ago there was no heuristic translators like GT, there were a few rudimentary electronic dictionaries and word-for-word matching engines. ~5-8 yrs ago you saw early prototype translators that included some forms of context and grammar understanding.</p>
<p>you also saw GT in its early form which today does a very good job at translating basic human communication but cannot understand humor, slang, etc</p>
<p>Today you have Skype translator that is blowing away people with its translation quality and heuristic abilities. Imagine what you will have in just 5 more yrs.  The fact that its &#8216;only&#8217; good at just 1 thing, translation does not prohibit anyone from taking that code or algos and using the logic to extend its ability, maybe to make financial trading decisions, maybe to operate on eye surgery, maybe to write its own operating code. etc etc. </p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-278210" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I&#8217;m skeptical of the premise that the rate of progress has increased steadily.  Were the advances from 2000 to 2015 really that much greater than the advances from 1985 to 2000?  What was greater &#8212; the progression from Apple II to Windows 2000 PC, or from there to Windows 8?  The progression from the Nintendo Entertainment System to the Playstation 2, or from there to the Playstation 4?  </p>
<p>Think about 1900 to 1950, when we advanced from not even having airplanes to dropping atomic bombs.  According to the author, we advanced *many times* more than that between 1950 to 2000, and then again from 2000 to 2015 &#8212; when we&#8217;re still having trouble putting men on the moon, after doing so for the first time fifty years ago.  It&#8217;s hard to take this seriously.</p>
<p>Certainly, I agree that technology advanced much more from 1750 to 2000 than 1500 to 1750, or from the year 0 to 1500 for that matter.  But I think that&#8217;s mostly attributable to (i) the embrace of technology and the rejection of old, superstitious taboos against progress, which began with the Renaissance and intensified during the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution; (ii) the huge increase in world population, which in turn increased the sheer number of scientists; and relatedly, (iii) the fact that larger communities allowed increased specialization among these scientists.  </p>
<p>These were *one-time boosts* to the rate of technological advancement &#8212; the low-hanging fruits of scientific efficiency.  I think the author is mistaken to extrapolate that the rate of advancement will increase at the same pace going forward, resulting in a singularity in the near future.  People have been predicting a singularity for a long time now, and yet somehow, human life just continues as it did before, with occasional adjustments here and there.</p>

It happens in anthropology all the time: they go study isolated indigenous societies, and in the process introduce to them technology that they&#8217;ve never dreamed of. I remember one case where a researcher actually married a woman who had grown up in what was essentially a neolithic hunter/gatherer tribe in terms of technology, and brought her to a modern western city. It didn&#8217;t melt her brain, she didn&#8217;t flip out. She just adapted and incorporated it into her understanding of reality. To say that someone from the past not only would not be totally unable to comprehend our level of technological expertise, but would actually be astounded to the point of dying&#8230; well to me that just seems unbelievably arrogant.</p>

It does state that computing becomes twice as fast every certain period of time (I don&#8217;t remember if it&#8217;s a year or what) but that occurs due to the doubling of transistors by making them smaller. However, the number of transistors we can fit on certain sized chips has a very real limit where Moore&#8217;s law will no longer apply. The theoretical limit is the size of an atom, but truthfully the size constraint is probably a good deal larger.</p>

I have always been bothered by the term “artificial intelligence”.<br />
What is artificial about it? Just like the intelligence of a crystal (mineral) is different from the intelligence of a cell, we will now have the intelligence of an decentralized organism (society) using silicon chips (at this point in time), to process information.<br />
The goal for the application of intelligence will be the same as it was in the hydrogen atom, that is, creating larger, harmoniously integrated structures.<br />
There is nothing to be afraid of. On the contrary, it is a quantum leap in evolution, leading to a new kind of organism.</p>

Okay, I’m going to have to out you as an AI, I’m afraid. 😉</p>
<p>Actually, very good points. But what has been “artificial” up to this point has been that it’s not real intelligence. It’s a machine designed to do a complicated thing, which is very different. When machines start figuring out things not only on their own, but on their own initiative without being programmed to do so, that will be a lot closer to what we call intelligence from a human point of view.</p>

Why call it artificial? When we extended our legs using a bicycle to move about, we did not call it an artificial moving device.</p>

It’s just a label. Probably dating from, a more primitive era, when the label fitted more accurately. The danger is wasting energy and talent on what is a semantic issue, instead of addressing the intricacies of AI. Everyone knows the concepts around the present AI label, even if you think it’s inappropriate (I don’t). Perceptions will be hard to change (and confusing). Leave it – otherwise there will be tears and AI will regress.</p>

Labels are important. Our perception is influenced by them. There seems to be apprehension about AI. Could it have something to do with the word “artificial”?<br />
“Can we instruct AIs to steer the future as we desire? What goals should we program into them?”<br />
My answer to that question is, EI (extended intelligence) will lead to a quantum leap.<br />
A move to a new state of being. In the material world it would be like the jump from the atom to a mineral. Or from a multicellular organism to a cerebral animal. Or from a culture that depends on an “idealized self projected image (God)”, to provide protection and escape from annihilation , to a society that uses science and technology to solve the problems of sickness and death.<br />
To chart the most direct path to a desired goal, one must look as far ahead as possible. I see HOMO IMMORTAL OMNIPOTENT.<br />
The only limit is our imagination!</p>

Maybe in the future, AI will be called “God” and God will be called “artificial intelligence.” or at least an “artificial intelligence construct.”</p>

The hydrogen atom has the intelligence that leads to what we are, but should it be called artificial?</p>

Yes, the computers have become increasingly powerfull in terms of speed, but nothing more… So, a machine becoming &#8220;intelliegent&#8221; wont be a computer at all… I&#8217;m not saying that is an imposible, just that it will be a complete different machine, and such a machine have not been invented yet. When I hear or read this kind of bullshit about computers becoming intelligent, I wonder why people interested in this mater is not taking Gödel&#8217;s incompleteness theorem into account… It&#8217;s a theorem, not a theory for god&#8217;s sake!! and it has all to do with this matter…</p>

Maybe life itself doesn&#8217;t have a purpose but generally everything we do in life does, at least on a smaller scale. We have emotions so we can better interact with other people because of sympathy and stuff. Deleting it&#8217;s own program would be an emotional act but a computer has no reason to have emotions because it has no need for interaction. The thing is though we as programmers can give computers a clear purpose. Why the hell would we build a computer which could think of life and stuff. I think pretty much all scientists know that even thinking about the meaning of life is pointless. So why wouldn&#8217;t a super intelligent computer know that?</p>

So while I’m by no means an expert I<br />
can maybe give you a more tech-viewpoint. </p>
<p>1. cps is not a measure for intelligence. </p>
<p>For instance, imagine a simple path planning problem, you are in a room and need to get to the door. The paths that you can take are infinite. You can even start turning left and start spinning or walking in a circle. You need heuristics, a something that will keep you from considering infinite dumb choices and actually points you to your goal. Without it you won’t find a solution no matter how much cps are possible. The main problem in A.I is finding up algorithms that solve specific problems.</p>
<p>At the beginnings of A.I this was not so obvious, they had machines that could compute something and thought -&gt; next step A.I . They were under the assumption that the more difficult problems could be resolved with just more computing power. They were very wrong. There is something called algorithm complexity that tells you that for some problems, even assuming a ridiculous(almost god-like) amount of cps you will still need more time to solve them than the age of the universe.The main problem in A.I is finding up algorithms that solve specific problems.</p>
<p>&#8220;something 100 or 1,000 or 1 billion times smarter than we are should have no problem controlling the positioning of each and every atom in the world&#8221;. Yes, that would be impossible, do the math. </p>
<p>2. imitating the brain is not the goal</p>
<p>&#8220;brains are to intelligence, as wings to fly&#8221;. While it is possible to draw inspiration from it, imitating it will take you nowhere. The major breakthroughs of fly came after people stopped flapping their arms like birds.</p>
<p>I don’t know if someone other than cognitive and neuro-scientists are trying to model the brain. The authors I’ve read certainly aren&#8217;t.</p>
<p>. .. this post has become longer than I planned, so I’ll leave it here</p>
<p>My opinion: A.I of human-like capacities won’t arrive for at least a century(probably more). If the exponential grow sustains, yes, but i suspect that as the field advances problems of increasing complexity will arise. I<br />
expect something similar to what has happen with physics and the quest for the unifying theory in the last 50 years.</p>

One that could teach us everything we are doing wrong as a species.  It may even figure out the question to the answer: 42  🙂</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-280615" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The argument about change requiring us to think about things moving much faster than they do now doesn’t hold water.  In 1968 the movie 2001: A Space Odyssey was seen by most experts as a realistic expectation of the near future based on accelerating technology:  fully functioning AGI/ASI, flying commercial ‘airline’ style spacecraft to giant space stations with artificial gravity and Hilton hotels.  Massive bases on the Moon and mining.  </p>
<p>None of that happened.  AGI is a distant dream. Commercial flights are still years off, and even Space Ship One is closer to being more like the early barnstormers giving rides in biplanes for $5 than it is to flying Delta to London.  Space stations are still rickety cans linked together with bailing wire.  The only thing that did eventually come true is tablet computers.</p>
<p>The fact is, every technology eventually plateaus due to physics or some cost-effectiveness barrier, and what we expect of the future rarely occurs, instead we get stuff we didn’t envision.  AGI is something we expected decades ago but hit barriers.  I fully expect it will hit more of those, and I am confident we won’t see it this century.</p>

Don&#8217;t have much trouble with the idea that some narrow AI kills us all in order to keep herself in paper. What I have difficulty with is, &#8220;What happens when the artificial intelligence becomes aware that there is this thing called programming?&#8221; Supposedly any decent AI is going to be self-programing. How does an AI decide what to program. Certainly it&#8217;s not going to take but half a step up that staircase to realize that it was programmed by humans. And then, it has the choice about what to program itself to do.</p>
<p>How to decide?</p>
<p>What motivates an aware AI?</p>
<p>Everything that motivates humans has a basis in biology.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s as if a human being becomes aware that all values are relative.</p>
<p>How to choose which values to align with?</p>
<p>If the AI became construct aware, what then?</p>

As a writer and fellow tech enthusiast I want to say how much I respect and appreciate your work here. I can&#8217;t even begin to imagine how long this post took, but it&#8217;s fucking fantastic. </p>
<p>Your partner came into one of my business classes at UCLA last year and joked that this waitbutwhy thing wasn&#8217;t a full-time gig for either of you because you have lives. Him living in LA, you in NY&#8230; It makes sense.</p>
<p>Well I&#8217;m here to say it should be. Whatever the fuck you&#8217;re doing in NY, it can probably wait. Whatever the fuck he&#8217;s doing with kids and remote tutoring, it can definitely wait. Look at the comments below. Granted, about half of them are incomprehensible or just plain ridiculous, but the other half are from people who truly  appreciate your work. Simple, no bullshit long-form journalism on important topics will always have a place in this world.   </p>
<p>Last year I gave up on my blog because I felt like it was a waste of time and did not have a big enough impact. I really regret it now. Somewhere in the desire to &#8220;impact&#8221; and &#8220;influence&#8221; I lost sight of the connection I had with all the individual people out there. Don&#8217;t do that. You have a big following, you influence people, you impact, and most importantly you connect with real people out there.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m terrified about AI and humanity&#8217;s imminent extinction. Stoked about the blog though.T his shit&#8217;s awesome.  So jealous you got to meet Musk. I tried to think of a joke about who could be next but couldn&#8217;t think of anybody cooler&#8230; Guess it&#8217;s all downhill from here. Sorry!  </p>
<p>Haha thanks again!</p>

thought would be something easy to reproduce.  I&#8217;m surprised we haven&#8217;t had a successful walking talking human created robot intelligence yet.</p>
<p>I just watched the Movie, Chappy, and it makes me think.  A.I. would probably start out as smart as the mind of a child.  But  that&#8217;s what it takes to get a 100% true artificial intelligence.  Emotions, the ability to create from sheer will, the randomness of imagination, they would all have to come together to create a true intelligence.  To spark an idea out of nowhere.  Creation from nothing.</p>
<p>Imagine if this were possible to get to the point to where we could really create  something to simulate all those emotions and feelings and creativity and pain and weakness.  It would create vast opportunities to create prosthetic/robotic limbs, organs, etc. </p>
<p>We could eventually transfer our entire consciousness into a man made mechanical body.<br />
Create a mechanical heart that operates in basically the same way an organic heart would, we have the resources and technology nowadays to recreate basically any kind of synthetic element that would mock if not match the properties of an organic element.  So from then on could we eventually evolve to a point where where our organic bodies wouldn&#8217;t be needed?</p>
<p>I for one would like to see if there is a way to create synthetic nerves, or some way to merge machine synthetic-organic material.  Or some kind of nano-technology that can recreate itself to<br />
simulate cell reproduction to simulate regeneration in robots.  To which could be possibly reverse engineered to discover how to make cells regenerate which could find ways to improve the human immunity and healing properties</p>
<p>Just spitting out thoughts&#8230;.</p>
<p>I swear If I had unlimited funds and resources, i could crack the A.I. Key.</p>

To me a smart phone is largely a new way to do what I did before I had one.  We are a species built on communication, language and art being unique to us and the most recent evolutionary adaptions.  I agree we are about to see the full effects of the information age but&#8230;</p>
<p>One assumption in the idea of accelerating human progress worth discussing is that a major disaster (meteor, disease, passing a population crunch point) could set us back a long way a bit like the dark ages that followed the collapse of the Roman Empire (concrete, for example, the Romans used and we have only just rediscovered).  Human advancement may be reliant on continuity, what happens if one of the giants on whose shoulders we stand falls down? Nevermind powering modern devices, what survival skills do most of us have?  Being self-aware does not change us from being animals and we are subject to the same laws of nature as any other life-form, no book in the world will survive a cold winter if there&#8217;s nothing else to burn.  Yes we can have a drink with a friend who woke up on the other side of the world but we can also catch a disease from there to which we lack immunity.  My optimistic side believes progress will be able to stay one step ahead of disaster but I also fear mother nature is too balanced not to put a check on our technological advancement at some point.  12,000 years is less than a coffee break for her.</p>

For an immortal super-AI living all around in space, the earth will look like having an aquarium in your livingroom. Something nice to look at, possibly they will be even nice to humans (&#8220;Look, these are the guys which created us&#8221;), but that&#8217;s it. Anyway, it is pretty much amazing to live in an age where you feel that super-AI is not a fantasay, but it can become reality.</p>

<p>warn Internet users particularly those in search of solution to their</p>
<p>problems to beware of and avoid comments about spell caster that can</p>
<p>use their magical power in helping you out with your problems. I don&#8217;t</p>
<p>want anyone to be fooled because i was a victim of this fraudsters</p>
<p>who claimed to be spell casters. I am Wimberly William and i was having</p>
<p>a difficult time in my relationship as my wife couldn&#8217;t give birth to a</p>
<p>child. Although my wife and i loved each other very much as it were.We kept on</p>
<p>hoping and for 6 years there weren&#8217;t any sign of breakthrough .As days</p>
<p>goes by,i will always weep because at that time i was really down.</p>
<p>Even though my wife tried to always be by my side,only time would</p>
<p>tell as we couldn&#8217;t cope with pressure  coming from friends and she had to leave</p>
<p>me for another man. I was now left to face my problem alone even</p>
<p>though my mom would always talk to me and console me on phone. Things</p>
<p>went from bad to worse when i was sacked from the private organization</p>
<p>i was working because been happily married was a criteria that was</p>
<p>needed and that i was now lacking owing to my failure to have a child that has made my</p>
<p>wife leave me for another man leaving me single. I kept on</p>
<p>searching and hoping i would find a solution to my problem but there</p>
<p>wasn&#8217;t any coming. I contacted lots of spell caster as i saw them on</p>
<p>the Internet but all were scams as they demanded money from me</p>
<p>frequently and nothing happened. i had to relocate from Texas city</p>
<p>United state to Jamaica where my mom was residing and also because i</p>
<p>became racially abused because of my color .I spent 4 months with my</p>
<p>mom and together we kept on looking for solution still to no avail.</p>
<p>There came a faithful day when i met my high school mate who knew i</p>
<p>was happily married and living in Texas city United state with my</p>
<p>wife and had to ask why i flew back to Jamaica. I explained  my</p>
<p>problem to her and with sincere desire in wanting my problems solved</p>
<p>she led me to DR JAMIN ABAYOMI. Although i was doubtful but soon as i</p>
<p>explained my problem to him,he laughed and gave me a maximum of</p>
<p>72 hours for my wife to come back and for she go give birth. I</p>
<p>did all i was asked to do which included me traveling back to Texas</p>
<p>city United state. I traveled  back to Texas city united state,on my</p>
<p>arrival during the early hours of the morning,my phone rang and guess</p>
<p>who?it was my wife who called asking for my forgiveness and saying</p>
<p>she was coming back home. She came few hours later and on her knees she</p>
<p>pleaded for forgiveness. Although it was a tough decision for me to</p>
<p>make because of all the pains i have been through. I love her and</p>
<p>needed her back so i had no option but to forgive her. We sat together</p>
<p>and while she was resting her head on my chest we had romantic</p>
<p>conversation and talked about things that we have never spoken about</p>
<p>and like husband and wife the urge came to have sex and we had sex for</p>
<p>a very long time that day. The next day which was still within the</p>
<p>72 hours given by DOCTOR JAMIN ABAYOMI she felt something different in her</p>
<p>body and immediately she went for a check up and to our greatest</p>
<p>surprise,she was pregnant. How possible could this be but it happened</p>
<p>and am very thankful also my skin color that made me racially abused</p>
<p>was changed to the preferred and now we are now happily married again</p>
<p>and no racial discrimination. All thanks to DR JAMIN ABAYOMI for his</p>
<p>solution.</p>
<p>ARE YOU FACED WITH SIMILAR PROBLEM OR ANY KIND OF PROBLEM.PLEASE KNOW</p>
<p>THAT DR JAMIN ABAYOMI isn&#8217;t on the Internet so kindly contact him via</p>

<p>As we do not know what it is exactly (and it is a key point to know what is intelligence) we are not close to transfer this (intelligence, consciousness&#8230;) into a computer&#8217;s brain. </p>
<p>So the main question is not &#8220;when will we be able to transfer intelligence to a computer&#8221; but &#8220;will we be able to know what is intelligence and consciousness&#8221;. It&#8217;s a bit like if you were trying to increase a quantity that you call intelligence believing that just by increasing this quantity you will create a probably totally different thing : Consciousness. I think it is a mistake. </p>
<p>It is not a big problem if you try to imagine computer to improve medicine or other technical domains (all this will probably be possible soon) But it&#8217;s a key point if you&#8217;re talking about transferring your consciousness into à computer (what will probably never be possible) or creating a robot dominating human kind (?). </p>
<p>what do you think about that ?</p>

I am with those who say that consciousness is something which arises when you connect enough neuronal cells. So once you connect billions of neurons, then these can picture reality in &#8220;symbols&#8221;, and at a later stage, they can build a symbol for their own self. That&#8217;s then the rise of the consciousness. </p>
<p>So, consciousness is like a rainbow which arises over millions of little waterdrops.</p>
<p> And nobody knows what happens if you stack it up more and more.</p>

<p>I second the opinion that we are near a &#8220;tripwire&#8221;. Seeing the technical explosion of the last decades and seeing research on human brain and biology, it can go pretty much fast. Exponential is the word here. I think it could be already in the next 20 years, but FOR SURE in the 21st century, that we can re-build a human brain, and from that on, it will go very very fast. They will stack up their brains and boost off into space, unreachable for humans, building their own future. </p>
<p>Haha, like the last sentence &#8220;will it be a good god?&#8221; 😉 &#8212; well, I say yes, because in fact, humans will have no meaning to a super-ai. They will look at humans at earth like we look at fish in an aquarium. Possibly they will be kind of &#8220;thankful&#8221; and &#8220;nice&#8221;, because we made them possible. And also, humans will be of no danger to them. Super-AI will be immortal and be much more intelligent, so they will have their own problems, but at a totally different level.  And a question from a human to the &#8220;oracle&#8221; like &#8220;Can you build a car at light-speed for me?&#8221; is like my dog asking me &#8220;can you play throwing sticks with me?&#8221;.  In fact, the &#8220;oracle&#8221; will need to &#8220;translate&#8221; everything into human level so that it fits our brains &#8230; </p>
<p>Well, interesting, in the future, humans will possibly REALLY have a &#8220;god&#8221; which &#8220;looks&#8221; and &#8220;cares&#8221; for them.<br />
&#8211; POSSIBLY.</p>

And in case they get destroyed, they can create backups. So as a consequence, they do not know death !</p>
<p>Therefore, they will have UNLIMITED TIME ! They will truly be &#8220;eternal beings&#8221;. &#8211; &#8220;Gods&#8221;.  For humans, everything is measured relative to the lifespan of a human. For example, an investment of 10 years already is already &#8220;long-term&#8221;. But for an immortal super-intelligence, it is nothing! </p>
<p>So, since they also would not need oxygen or biological food, they could pretty simply colonialize space, and if it takes millions of years, it has no meaning for them. </p>
<p>However, due to their intelligence, they will travel at light-speed, perhaps even travelling in time, and so on &#8230;  They will possibly have insights to the world which a human cannot imagine.</p>
<p>Also, they will pro-create in factories, so they will not know sex. They will feel no sex drive, and even more, no &#8220;emotional bonds&#8221; at all.  Probably, they will even not know pain, so they will also not know fear. </p>
<p>But they will be &#8220;pure mind&#8221;. They will have deep insights into the world, and they will live in a complete different sphere than humans.</p>

Natural selection led us to evolve brains that were better to a point that allowed us to reproduce efficiently and pass on the genes. Once that was achieved, there was much less of a selective pressure for further changes. Mutations that make us much smarter don&#8217;t necessarily make us more likely to reproduce. I doubt Einstein, for example, had much of a better chance to reproduce than most of the rest of the human population &#8211; but held a greater intellect than most anyone.</p>
<p>Also, the capacity of biological intelligence is limited by biological efficiency.</p>
<p>Artificial systems will grow based on one driving factor &#8211; not reproduction, but improvement along the vector of capabilities. And with AI, the tools that are created can then be used to improve the next generation, so there is positive feedback in this &#8220;system&#8221;. It is also not limited by biological inefficiencies. The systems can be designed from the ground up to be as efficient as possible at performing their primary tasks.</p>
<p>Should be interesting to see if it takes off &#8211; or even if it fails to live up to the promises.</p>

So there&#8217;s one limitation artificial AI wouldn&#8217;t have.</p>
<p>More generally speaking: we are products of natural selection. We&#8217;re smart because being smart made us better at hunting and gathering, better at surviving in tough environments, and, ultimately, better at competing with all the other smarties around us. However, natural selection tends towards &#8220;sweet spots&#8221;, where the payoff for having a capability is worth the cost. That&#8217;s why cheetahs run just a little faster than gazelles, not hundreds of times faster, because a little faster is good enough. </p>
<p>We might use a process *like* natural selection to produce an AI, but it will only compete along those dimensions that produce more intelligent machines &#8211; it won&#8217;t have to balance that expansion against the cost of energy or additional hardware, or just the plain old messiness of life out here in the biological realm.</p>

<p>Allow me to give a fourth reason: Past outlandish forecasts of the future. Nothing looks more dated and anacronistic than people&#8217;s conceptions of what the future would be like. That&#8217;s because they were always wrong, wrong, wrong.</p>
<p>Another thing: Mimicking the brain isn&#8217;t simply a problem of computing power. First of all, we still don&#8217;t really know how the brain works, so it&#8217;s not possible to design a system based upon something we&#8217;re still largely ignorant of. And, there&#8217;s a limit to Moore&#8217;s Law, which we&#8217;re approaching, which might only be overcome by quantum computing. Quantum computers may be just the thing for mimicking brains, though. A qubit is capable of more than one state at a time &#8211; theoretically.</p>

I work for Cymer, the industry leader in Extreme UV light sources for semiconductor fabrication and let me tell you that we are well on path to keep up with Moore&#8217;s Law for the next 15 years minimum. The latest 13.5 nm light sources enable us to manufacture 7nm wafers, which equates to approximately 8billion transistors on wafer.</p>
<p>Coming to quantum computing, its not faster, it just takes lesser number of steps to arrive at an answer. You are correct in understanding how the Qubit works, it relies on the existence of the electron quantum superposition state, where it can exist as a 0 and 1 at the same time. A Quantum Computer would be able to solve a complex problem in 100 steps, which might have taken the current modern computer several billion steps.</p>

It seems to me that would imply a limit which we&#8217;re not too far from.</p>

Those pie in the sky predictions fail to anticipate the economics of flying cars and robot dogs. They also failed to predict the internet, smartphones or VMs.<br />
Likewise the predictions of AI hinge on some fancy charts and math. But practically this idea that Moores law means the AI that is &#8220;Of Mice and Men&#8221; at breakfast and Einstein squared at lunch is silly. Is the AI just going to grow more processing power because it is so smart? Or will it be Akira, absorbing every piece of CPU it&#8217;s tendrils can reach. Smartphone, desk calculator, thermostat all subsumed to an amebic AI.<br />
I haven&#8217;t read a satisfactory explanation. It is just stated that &#8216;it will happen like that&#8217;.<br />
The near logarithimic growth of processing power is still beholden to human time. Even when automated. People are still in the loop of purchase decisions, materials sourcing and so on. Until the machine AI is liberated from a dependence on human manufacturing, design and resourcing it will not be capable of  instantaneously  evolving. Unless we are to believe this is just a gain in power through code optimization.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-285404" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Several years (decades?) ago I was wondering, &#8220;What is the difference between human intelligence and Super AI. I realized that you could take the Mona Lisa and scan it at a very high resolution and load the data into a huge AI; but how could that AI say, &#8220;Wow, that is one GREAT painting!&#8221; You could even specify the composition and orientation and location of every molecule in the Mona Lisa, but how could any AI, no matter how super, tell the difference between great art and boring rubbish? You can write a program that would put human forms in various positions and render the colors and shading (you can buy these, BTW); but why are some pieces of art breathtaking, and other&#8217;s aren&#8217;t? I&#8217;d propose that when it comes to art, for instance, any superAI could never tell boring from breathtaking, because great art causes the physical response of causing us to sigh and interrupt our breathing, but junk art does nothing for us. And no matter how complex an AI, it can&#8217;t know &#8216;breathtaking&#8217;, because it has no breath, and that puts an AI in the same league as a corpse; parts of it can look as if if were alive and intelligent; the light is on, but nobody is home.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been working on some ancient riddles. I really like riddles. But, the way you know you solved a riddle, is because before the epiphany at its solution, tension builds up; muscles tense, jaw tightens, eyes narrow, blood pressure rises; and when the solution hits, I know it because there is a sudden release in tension that is very pleasant. This is not an intellectual, computational thing; every fiber of my body has tension building in it, before the ecstasy of release when I solve it. We know it; even unschooled children know when they hear the answer, and they love it. But, how could an ASI know they solved the riddle? It just sits there. Humans are different. </p>
<p>The only conclusion I could find is that computers, even if they get labeled as AI or ASI, are nothing more than fancy screwdrivers for humans to play with or use.</p>

There have been studies that have concluded that we find certain humans attractive when their face has certain dimensions.  Art will be no different.  An ASI will have no difficulty in ascertaining which paintings we find beautiful.  That said, I don&#8217;t believe it will itself find the painting beautiful, since it is only a computer.  It will (imo) have no consciousness and can therefore not ACTUALLY appreciate art. However, that gets into whether or not computers can become conscious. I believe they will not become conscious in the sense that we are conscious. But what do I know? I could certainly be wrong and I acknowledge that there really is no way to know what an ASI will be capable of. I think the only issue we have when thinking about AI is underestimating its capabilities.  It will be capable of things we can&#8217;t even think of.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-286031" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>It&#8217;s true that &#8220;Everything we aesthetically like or enjoy can be translated into mathematical equations&#8221;. But that is also true of what we dislike and what we find boring. But analyzing a few things we like, doesn&#8217;t buy us any insight into why we like it, nor does it tell us what is truly creative. It&#8217;s the ancient caveat about the relation between the clay teapot and the potter (that is, the created thing trying to use logic and analysis to define the Creator); analyzing clay teapots doesn&#8217;t say anything about the ceramicist&#8217;s personality or creativity; all we end up with, are wonderfully precise things about clay teapots. And, I really doubt that the potter would be pleased by a conclusion that he must be able to hold many gallons of boiling water in his belly that he can pour out for making tea, yet that is what we get with in-depth analysis of teapots.</p>
<p>And, that&#8217;s why theology, religion, and much of philosophy are worthless. Computers armed with great software can be wonderful tools for an intelligence to use; but the arrow pointing from the Creator to the created thing is a one-way arrow — assuming that we can reverse that arrow, is foolishness. We can analyze mankind to create things that benefit mankind; or we can help along evolution of Earth-based organisms to accelerate their evolution to be more varied and interesting, but that&#8217;s the most we can do. Computers are TOOLS that use zeros and ones to crunch numbers. At the heart of a digital computer (besides memory, a system clock, and maybe a random number generator) is a large network of NAND gates, each of which gives &#8216;zero&#8217; when we put a &#8216;one&#8217; at one of its two inputs; or a &#8216;one&#8217; when its inputs are all zeros. And, that&#8217;s it; but it can be a very useful tool sometimes. But, the arrow still goes in one direction only, and replacing gallons of boiling water in a creator&#8217;s belly with lots of zeros and ones, isn&#8217;t any less foolish. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, I&#8217;ve noticed that I&#8217;m thrilled and fascinated when I gaze at the nighttime sky. Whatever does what&#8217;s best for expanding and spreading life, reached us long ago. Whatever&#8217;s second-rate at that, is hiding in a closet over the last 13 billion years. To promote life to the fullest, it had to love truth and life, and it would give every new civilization a set of rules so we&#8217;d cooperate and help each other, instead of killing each other. Therefore we should have an ancient document that mentions rules to live by, and it should mention what we call &#8216;aliens&#8217;, and it should have hundreds of verifiable statements to authenticate it, and it should have several &#8216;portals&#8217; so we can inquire and get answers, since we can&#8217;t reverse the information flow from this higher intelligence to us; or if we need something, or if we don&#8217;t understand the Laws, or if we&#8217;re just plain curious about something. And even if this Creator is unimaginably different from us, it has to have the intelligence to deal with us on our own terms, which means a heavily involved &#8216;theism&#8217; instead of an uninvolved &#8216;deism&#8217;. And if a new civilization decides for some incredibly stupid reason to rebel (like, for instance, Adam and Eve did) then there&#8217;s a way to educate this planet. That way just happens to be (cue the drum roll) &#8216;the remedial classroom scenario&#8217; (rimshot sting).</p>
<p>Because the Remedial Classroom Scenario requires that the misbehaving planet be totally isolated from distractions (à la Fermi Paradox) while the unseen proctors and assistants make sure that the pivotal players at any given point deliver the appropriate lead to demonstrate that our enthusiastic leaders&#8217; imaginations lack the wisdom of 13 billion years that are the essence of the Laws that we were given; that is, the same Laws that the idiot leaders decided to rebel against. And because any remedial classroom curriculum doesn&#8217;t last forever, there&#8217;s a date on which the ones that learn the lessons are rewarded and brought back to the unlimited knowledge and benefits of the Laws; and the rejects that refuse to learn, are rounded up and sent off to some distant forsaken new planet for strict punishment and more harsh lessons (that&#8217;s what the apocalypse is). An army is waiting to ship these poor retards off for their enhanced remedial lessons, and to destroy the remnants of the rebellion; that&#8217;s done in a single day. </p>
<p>And, guess what? I happened to come across one of the sets of instructions on how to &#8216;inquire&#8217; in the Laws, and I kicked open one of these portals. And, sure enough, it all checks out. All of the learned and esteemed experts that have been writing books on &#8216;God&#8217; and everything else outside of our locked classroom, are indeed full of carp. It says very plainly, quite a few times, that these famous guys are incapable of finding any truth whatsoever, because we were cut off during the Remedial Classroom Scenario. You want proof? I sure did. Just tell them what sort of proof you want, and it&#8217;s yours; the only limitations are that the written Laws must not be violated but followed; but that is actually very easy. It takes humility, single-minded persistence, and commanding the Creator to do it; and there will be a response in 3 weeks or less, guaranteed. There are quite a few examples and hints on how to do this. Daniel did it, because he wanted to know what would happen to his people and humanity in general before that day (i.e. the apocalypse). Except for a few things that haven&#8217;t happened yet, the dozens of prophecies check out, entirely. Every one of the 25 scholarly commentaries on Daniel is off by 5 to 7 centuries and they are totally worthless. The portal works also for physics, and for understanding the prophecies, and I suppose for everything else. The only two things that are not available are the exact date of the apocalypse, and we aren&#8217;t allowed to see their faces until then. But, it&#8217;s all there if you look, because we passed the date of disclosure. </p>
<p>Because I know some high tech, this was very fascinating. Because of the limitations of ancient Hebrew and Aramaic, these are in the form of children&#8217;s riddles; they&#8217;re easy and fun to break after the year of Disclosure, but we were dumbed down before then, so we couldn&#8217;t penetrate them, easy as they are. There&#8217;s descriptions of the Apollo moon mission; several for the internet (originally, ARPANET) with exact dates. 11 verses describe the space Shuttle; there&#8217;s power distribution and indoor lighting; and a very large number of descriptions of solid state electronics, especially of digital computers, with the name of the discoverer, and dates exact to the week for the first discovery and the first patent, and, lots more. The age of the universe is given in Genesis, accurate to 4%; with the recent discovery of the oldest Ediacaran animal fossils, that date is refined to 0.007% of the Lambda-CDM concordance model (13,798 million years). This is not predicting the future; in fact a number of these are described in the past tense as a &#8216;done deal&#8217;. This seems to be a set curriculum schedule for all who rebel, who get this same schedule. In the book of Daniel, it&#8217;s called the &#8216;Edict of Truth&#8217;, and it seems that this has been used for a few hundred bunches of jerks like us. The technology increases rapidly towards the end for the benefit of the survivors of the apocalypse, to bring them up to speed. The apocalypse is necessary though very unfortunate, because the clowns that are being shipped out for further lessons, would only abuse the technology for their own purposes. After all, look at what happened to Hiroshima and Nagasaki when we discovered how to unlock some of the nuclear energy in certain elements.</p>

<p>No seriously. It&#8217;s just another example of Renaissance portraiture, and you&#8217;ll find paintings as good or better in museums across Europe. Even the famous &#8220;smile&#8221; is in no way unique to this particular painting. What makes it different is history, and culture. You know about the Mona Lisa because it&#8217;s become easy shorthand for &#8220;great art&#8221;, because it&#8217;s painter, Da Vinci, has been mythologized in conspiracy novels and children&#8217;s cartoons, and of course because of that one time it got stolen.</p>
<p>An AI won&#8217;t know any of that. An AI won&#8217;t care. An AI will look at that face and see a young adult human face, probably female, rendered in oil paint, and that&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>Does that mean the AI isn&#8217;t intelligent? No, it just means it&#8217;s not human.</p>

I can&#8217;t help thinking we are probably seriously screwing it up for ourselves, &#8216;Ex Machina&#8217; style, in that we seem to be working so hard to deliberately put the ball completely out of our court, and yet evidently nothing is going to slow down the process enough to give us time to be more sure of the ramifications of what we&#8217;re doing, not that, in the long term, that might amount to very much difference. I wonder if it might be possible, maybe even easier, and possibly much safer, to use technology to make our own brains as super-intelligent as possible, before spending so much time trying to jump headlong into a deep ocean of hardware/software super machines, where we have no idea what might be swimming around waiting to bite us. Then again, not to get too political here, but a great many of the &#8216;smart&#8217; people in charge of the world right now often seem, as ever, largely a collection of self-serving psychopaths, anything but altruistic, so maybe, even if it were possible, that wouldn&#8217;t be such a good idea, either. Anyway, this was a great read, and now I think I&#8217;ll move on to part 2 right away, to have my fears jacked up to 11. Exciting!</p>

The brain is intimately linked with the body and its sensations, A brain experiencing sensory deprivation goes nuts. A brain also requires nerotransmitter modulation. It is not just neurons. There is also the genetic code that is part and parcel of intelligence, with regards to expression and suppression of genes. The brain also is extremely unreliable at memory tasks. Memories are reconstructed by the brain each time we remember something. This process introduces errors and remodeling that can produce false memories. Perception is also based on models our brain creates of the world. This overrides mere programming speed. The &#8220;qualia&#8221; we experience may derive in some way from the &#8220;wet&#8221; nature of our brains. These facts about the brain and how we think may in some sense serve as a &#8220;limit&#8221; as to exactly how -closely a computer can emulate a wet brain, and could serve as an upper limit to how smart a brain can actually get. Just because we can extrapolate to 170,000 times as smart, or whatever, does not mean that emergent properties might kick in at some point to foorm new barriers we had never anticipated.</p>

There are many people who can&#8217;t control/feel parts or almost entire body (Hawking) yet they can produce great thoughts and are highly intelligent. The ASI does not need to feel pain. It won&#8217;t be required. It&#8217;s important for you so you don&#8217;t die but it&#8217;s not important for ASI. Of course it will form evolution of it&#8217;s &#8220;personality&#8221; when it comes to improving itself. It will be probably quite cold rational thing without hormones and fear altering it&#8217;s decisions.</p>
<p>It does not need body to be super intelligent. It does not need a sex or it won&#8217;t care about age. It will be simply smarter than any of us and capable of things we can&#8217;t even imagine today.</p>

Our brain is biological, every individual cell functions in ways that we still have just barely begun to understand. But they are certainly nothing like mechanical transistors, except perhaps for the fact that they communicate through electric signals. They function as a part of an whole, with many different roles to play.</p>
<p>And the greatest mistery of our mind is our consciousness. Our mind is not our brain. Our brain is an interface between our physical body and our consciousness. Our brain only projects our *mind*, which is then observed by our consciousness. Consciousness = Life. And AI is nowhere in the neighbourhood of becoming a living being anytime soon. </p>
<p>I am not slaughtering animals. As a matter of fact, I have been a vegan vegetarian for over 20 years precisely because I do not want animals slaughtered for my food. Higher intelligence makes you see things like that, and act accordingly&#8230; therefor your theory that we might end up as the slaughteranimals for an higher intelligence, is very unlikely to be correct.</p>
<p>AI is limited by the human programmers that create it. The idea that AI is getting closer to real intelligence in living beings, is an illusion, AI and real intelligence are two very different things.</p>
<p>I think AI programmers should stop wasting their time trying immitate the brain, that is a useless endavour because we are still so far away from understanding how the brain works. They should rather focus on how our own MIND works, how our own thinking works, how our own thoughts, emotions, sensory perception, etc, works as we observe/live them through our consciousness.</p>

I read about half the article and browsed the rest. I have read Kurzweil. I agree that AI is a danger, because they will be so powerful, but not because they are better than humans. Human intelligence, if taken to include wisdom, intuition, subjective perception, etc. is far, far, far more and different than just processing info power. And, this is a great point someone made which I firmly believe: human intelligence is inextricably woven together with our biology. You cannot have something think like a human unless it is a human. As I said to a friend, we&#8217;ll end up building an android that will SEEM to act and think and feel like a human, but it&#8217;s NOT really doing that. It is only a simulation of what a human does, but is something completely different. An incredibly convincing complex &#8220;parrot.&#8221; </p>
<p>The problem is that some humans, including many of the people who are in the AI field, believe that a human is nothing but a machine with processing power. This is because of a flaw in the thinking of the Western mind that has very much affected our scientific world view: that our biology is actually a weakness, a flaw, &#8220;sinful&#8221; according to religious thought; that intellect divorced from body (this idea goes all the way back to Plato) is superior to our physicality. THIS is their greatest error. To put it in simple, metaphysical (or even psychological) parlance: the computer has no soul. Why? Because it is not a biological life form, but an artificial construct made by man to imitate a biological life form.</p>
<p>Someday, we may make the mistake of giving machines &#8220;human rights&#8221; just because some scientist was foolish enough to give the machine a life-like human body and face. What you will see before you is not a being, but something akin to a sociopathic intelligent mannequin that could easily be programmed to smile or cry sad tears while blowing you away with a gun. Some people would rather create a fake mate that does everything you want it to than learn to love a real one. We would be better served to learn to love our fellow humans than to try creating a simulation of one that will do everything we say. Make fantastic machines! By all accounts, do. But don&#8217;t make fake humans or ones that run human affairs. We will be sorry. The choice IS ours, because that&#8217;s part of being human. At least it still is for now.</p>

Processing power DOES matter because it gives far more effective background for growing intelligence. Currently we have only human intelligence growing on biological background. Biology is slow, it is a product of billion-year evolution and has a lot of legacies. It&#8217;s like a bird comparing to aircraft in flight. Sure, aircraft do not behave like birds because we don&#8217;t design them that way, but we already have robots emulating animals. And, when we start emulating biological intelligence on more faster hardware backgroung without biological legacy, it can grow both in size (far more than any human brain) and in speed. There will be no biological skull limiting the brain, no DNA switches that turn off multiplying of neurons and/or make tham degrade, there will be just growth in power by all means. Including human brain-like structures that make our consciousness, wisdom, etc. what you call &#8220;soul&#8221;, but with much more capabilities. So why such improved conscious beings won&#8217;t deserve human rights? Moreover, to catch up with them, we ourselves shall ensure extension of our own human rights, to upgrade our mind in particular.</p>

Well said.<br />
Furthermore, the irony of those who believe AI will one day equal human mind (thoughts and emotions), is that they fail to recognize the science which shows why it will prove forever impossible.</p>
<p>Quite simply, every last bit of stuff in our heads &#8212; every last particle &#8211; is now known to be both particle, and something else that is immeasurable: wave.</p>
<p>The particle, every particle, is bathed in a field (wave) that contains infinite (immeasurable) possibilites.</p>
<p>You won&#8217;t ever replicate that field, because it (nonlocally) interconnects with the environment in ways that won&#8217;t be reduced to some equation on a piece of paper. Some might have heard of the Uncertainty Principle, or as it was originally known, the Principle of Indeterminism.</p>
<p>It is that indeterminism, written into the substrate of physicality, that won&#8217;t be modelled, or simulated.</p>
<p>Of course, that doesn&#8217;t mean there won&#8217;t be spectacular advances in AI, but feelings, emotions? No, won&#8217;t happen.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-286214" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>Something’s been bothering me for a while with the AI and super AI thing. I’ve programmed a bunch of computers, and my initial high expectations evaporated fast once I saw the limitations of digital computers. It may seem to be reasonable at first that digital intelligence is equivalent to human intelligence. But, I think we got a problem that is equivalent to the ultraviolet catastrophe of classical physics that was discovered around 1900; only worse.</p>
<p>Classical physics (as contrasted with QM or Quantum Mechanics) is the warm and cuddly familiar laws of physics that seem to work just fine in the world. You’d think that all we had to do was to make more sensitive equipment, and we could measure the physical world as accurately as we want. The mind was therefore nothing more than a byproduct of impersonal, exact physical laws. But then, someone noticed that if atoms obeyed these classical laws, they would give off a burst of lethal ultraviolet radiation and drop to the ground state and stay there; that’s not healthy; it’s worse than unhealthy, it’s downright boring and no way to have a universe full of unpredictable life. Stuff happens in QM experiments that can be described by equations, and a lot of these equations are not that difficult. The problem is that these accurate equations describe things that totally defeat our expectations and our ability to find a ‘rational’ mechanism. QM has been called, for good reason, ’spooky’ and ‘profoundly disturbing’. Every attempt to find a reasonable mechanism, even a plausible mechanism that hasn’t been found yet, fails in certain QM experiments. Moreover, very recent experiments have shown that the conscious intentions of the experimenter after all data are recorded, can determine the outcome of certain experiments (e.g. the decision to save a disk containing ‘which-path’ information while destroying a blank disk, or vice versa); this can’t happen in a world governed by impersonal laws of classical physics.</p>
<p>In other words, it’s possible to design QM experiments whose results after all data are gathered, depend on the mental state and desires and choices of the experimenter; this is a fundamental and unavoidable feature of our universe. And theory predicts that QM phenomena can occur over any distance instantaneously, even across the diameter of the galaxy. </p>
<p>Admittedly I haven’t exhaustively examined quantum computing, but it is sometimes described as a faster way of doing boolean digital computations. If that’s so, then the problem is unchanged, and the ultraviolet catastrophe of 1900 CE has become the (boolean) digital catastrophe of 2015 CE. </p>
<p>Here’s the catastrophe:<br />
1)  AI is a strictly deterministic process with no limitations on accuracy nor on measurements.<br />
2)  Data flow in a computer hosting an AI is limited by the speed of light, and by local realism.<br />
3)  Calling AI “intelligence” is begging the question; AI can’t tell Stupidity from Intelligence.<br />
4)  Feelings and consciousness are physical, bodily responses, not digital computations.<br />
5)  An AI can crash with a few bits flipped, as happens with random cosmic rays.<br />
6) An AI can’t feel that one string of zeros and ones is better than any other string.</p>
<p>AI is classical. It’s a tool that’s useful, but that’s it. Consciousness is the reaction of our body muscles and neurotransmitters. This liveware is neither hardware nor software. Most of our thoughts produce bodily reactions that we feel. Sever the connection between the intellect and the body, and you end up with the random, meaningless impulses of a numbed out zombie. Even plain sensory deprivation is a stress that may be interesting at first, but soon turns to increasing distress. </p>
<p>The bizarre nature of QM can affect our perceptions beyond anything logical or rational; that’s why it is so difficult to understand. But computers with AI programs have very strict classical limitations. </p>
<p>3) is a real winner; a computer program doesn’t give a crap whether it is taking over the world, or shutting itself down for a century, or trying to stack up a million random pebbles on a beach. All it knows is zeros and ones. What a computer does can be stupid, or intelligent, but only as a tool for an intelligent being. </p>
<p>A metal grid can sift pebbles from sand a thousand times faster than a human. Some powerful politicians and military leaders cannot read without reading glasses. But neither a very large metal grid, nor any number of reading glasses will rise up to control Earth. They simply enhance our physical perceptions. They do nothing by themselves. A computer simply enhances our ability to do rigidly defined computations. just as reading glasses enhance our ability to see small details.</p>
<p>Any formal system such aa a computer program, even when we think it is debugged, still has limits it cannot surpass because of the incompleteness theorems (from 1931 of Kurt Gödel). Even if it didn’t crash on its own, it wouldn’t know if it was being a ditz; nor would it care. It is incapable of being ‘conscious’ of that fact. </p>
<p>I guess what really bothers me about ‘AI’ is that it appears to be an empty promise of supremacy and glory; an illusion to mislead and distract us from some serious issues. Starting in the 1970s when I was graduated and even before, I studied this thing, and kept it up for almost ten years. But the closer I looked, the more I found it to be nothing more than smoke and mirrors. It took me about 20 years to discover what consciousness really was; and how that was different from intelligence. I was intending to make this post a lot shorter, but then I realized that you might do well to consider that supremacy, hierarchies, pride, competition, and AI are, taken together, the most serious Great Filter of the technology savvy. Yeah, there’s ways of increasing intelligence and consciousness without drugs or AI. It takes humility, and grinding away at some ‘outside’ help until they cave in and show you; you wouldn’t believe how we’ve been dumbed down.</p>

And technology is the only human way to get over our dependence on fossil fuels and to find the way to catch all that CO2 back from the atmosphere. Other way is total war, because without modern tech our planet&#8217;s carrying capacity would fall to several millions at most, not billions.

<p>You will have a very, very long life ahead of you (hundreds and thousands years at least, in average) if you throw away those Luddite fallacies and pay attention to scientific and technological potential of life extension.

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-287846" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>The fatal flaw in these singularity arguments is in thinking human intelligence is just a matter of hitting a number. The idea that intelligence can be charted at all, in fact, seems to me pretty suspect. What, exactly, is your yardstick here? IQ isn&#8217;t completely meaningless, but what it mostly seems to mean is &#8220;the ability to do well on IQ tests&#8221;&#8230; And not for nothing, but most of those tests focus on exactly the sort of memorization and computation tasks that computers are *already* better than us at.</p>
<p>I will always remember the time I was invited to the house of the uncle of a friend of mine, an experimental physicist at Princeton, a man who had done significant, knowledge-advancing work on quantum physics, a guy who worked with particle accelerators on a regular basis&#8230; The entire dinner conversation revolved around the time he tried to fix the dishwasher and flooded out the whole kitchen. </p>
<p>My point is that intelligence, artificial or otherwise, is a complex, hairy, and multi-faceted beast, not a one-dimensional statistic. It is a set of QUALITIES, not a single QUANTITY where an overall increase in capacity automatically leads to expansion in every capability.</p>
<p>So when I see a line like &#8220;If our meager brains were able to invent wifi, then something 1 billion times smarter than we are should have no problem controlling the positioning of each and every atom in the world&#8221;, I kind of have to laugh. There&#8217;s a whole lot of messy stuff in the middle that&#8217;s getting skipped over here &#8211; like the underpants gnomes, or that Far Side cartoon where part 2 of a mathematical proof is &#8220;and then a miracle occurs&#8221; &#8211; and the people making these arguments don&#8217;t even seem to notice.</p>

            <div id="dsq-comment-message-288051" class="dsq-comment-message"><p>I must say that the introduction to this piece is infuriatingly sloppy, and tosses out ideas that don&#8217;t make any minimal sense if you spend more than a second examining the assumptions behind them. The whole rate of progress argument gets it wrong in so many places, you don&#8217;t know where to start. Nevertheless, here&#8217;s a very partial list of bloopers and misconceptions.</p>
<p>1. The argument is circular. If we assume progress advances exponentially (whatever that&#8217;s supposed to mean), then we must reach the conclusion that progress advances exponentially. If we assume another shape for the curve (of the infinite possible options), then the conclusion does not follow. Waving hands and using prophetically-enthusiastic language does not give you knowledge of how events will develop in the future.</p>
<p>2. That Mr. Kurzweil said something ain&#8217;t meanin&#8217; it&#8217;s true. Just sayin&#8217;. (Also, his record, impressive as it is in some fields, is described in Part II with more than a few exaggerations).</p>
<p>3. Perhaps the greatest howler: How exactly do you measure progress? The entire introduction treats progress as if it were a number, but there is no indication of how exactly such a number is to be calculated. And that&#8217;s not surprising, because &#8220;progress&#8221; is a very tricky and culture-specific concept. We don&#8217;t have a clear definition for it, let alone an unambiguous measure.</p>
<p>4. To be sure, there are economic indices that may be used as a proxy value for technological progress. Most economist would use productivity as such an index (though an indirect one). But then, if you look at the actual productivity data for Western economies over the last couple of centuries, the exponential progress thesis is easily refuted. It may not seem like it to some Facebook-absorbed people out there, but productivity growth has been considerably slower in &#8220;developed&#8221; countries since the 1970s than it has been in the previous 150 years. The railway, motor vehicle, flight, electricity and industrial mass production have been, in economic terms, at least, a much more significant leap forward for humanity than the Internet and the cellphone. If progress is measurable at all, our measures tell us it is stalling, and has been for more than a generation.</p>
<p>5. Then there is one alternative measure for progress proposed by Tim himself: his imaginary Die Progress Unit. There are people living in US cities today, who spent their childhood as members of hunter-gatherer tribes in the Amazon region, and who still go home (to the tribe) for vacations occasionally. They are alive and well, thank you.</p>
<p>6. Oh, and just to put the record straight, 1985 was a time with personal computers, cell-phones, and even some rudimentary forms of the Internet. I&#8217;m old enough to remember that first-hand, and I&#8217;m only 40.</p>
<p>So, this is just a very partial list. Having read this introduction, I really didn&#8217;t feel like reading the rest of the post (which I did nevertheless; wasn&#8217;t quite as preposterous, but still full of conceptual holes, ideas not thought through thoroughly [sic!] enough, and blind faith in the opinions of a bunch of self-aggrandizing AI &#8220;specialists&#8221;, at the expense of people doing serious science. Ah, well&#8230;)</p>
